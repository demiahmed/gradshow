            <p class="bottom solo left">We are proud to share with you the winners of the 2020 MArch Thesis awards. 
                <br><br>
                Two prestigious overall awards reflect the best thesis projects overall. The <i>DP Architects Design Excellence Award</i> recognises the best final design project submitted by a graduating student in the Master of Architecture degree program, and is voted by the Architecture and Sustainable Design Faculty. The <i>Master of Architecture Thesis Award - Representation</i> recognizes the final design project that goes furthest in advancing representation of architecture, as voted by the members of the graduating March class and the faculty. Together these awards recognise the best in progressive ideas and innovation in the school this year. 

                <br><br>
                SUTD Architecture and Sustainable Design also sponsors five thematic awards reflecting our programmes areas of excellence: Social Innovation, Future Manufacturing, Design Computation, Research Innovation, Sustainable Environments.
                <br><br>
                The winners of these awards have been selected after a rigorous two-phase process; first nominated by our faculty and then judged by a distinguished panel of reviewers from leading practices and academic institutions from Singapore and around the world. 
                <br> <br>
                Congratulations to all recipients!</p>
