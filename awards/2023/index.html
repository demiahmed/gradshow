            <p class="caption0 solo left">Awards Introduction</p>
            <p class="bottom solo left">We are proud to share with you the winners of the 2023 MArch Thesis awards. 
                <br><br>
                Two prestigious overall awards reflect the best thesis projects overall. The <i>DP Architects Design Excellence Award</i> recognises the best final design project submitted by a graduating student in the Master of Architecture degree program, and is voted by the Architecture and Sustainable Design Faculty. The <i>Master of Architecture Thesis Award - Representation</i> recognizes the final design project that goes furthest in advancing representation of architecture, as voted by the members of the graduating March class and the faculty. Together these awards recognise the best in progressive ideas and innovation in the school this year. 

                <br><br>
                SUTD Architecture and Sustainable Design also sponsors five thematic awards reflecting our programmes areas of excellence: Social Innovation, Future Manufacturing, Design Computation, Research Innovation, Sustainable Environments.
                <br><br>
                The winners of these awards have been selected after a rigorous two-phase process; first nominated by our faculty and then judged by a distinguished panel of reviewers from leading practices and academic institutions from Singapore and around the world. 
                <br> <br>
                Congratulations to all recipients!</p>
        

            <p class="caption0 solo left">This Year's Awards</p>
            
            
            <p class="solo left medium">Introducing the Praxis Innovation Award </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                The Praxis Innovation prize will be awarded for the first time at SUTD in 2023.

                <br><br>
                
                This prize recognises the MArch thesis that most compellingly articulates the value proposition of architecture while responding creatively to the parameters of architectural practice. 

                <br><br>

                The prize committee consider thesis projects that: 
            <br><br>
            - advance architectural practice through research
            <br><br>
            - demonstrate architectural leadership in professional and/or community groups
            <br><br>
            - propose innovative architectural business models
            <br><br>
            - innovatively respond to code and/or Sustainability constraints
            <br><br>

                
            </p>
            <br><br>
            
            <p class="solo left medium">Sustainable Environments </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                There is a growing duty for architects to produce designs that provide quality spaces at the lowest cost to the environment. To contribute positively to the building's inhabitants and the natural world. This award aims to identify the project which demonstrates the most sophisticated response to the need for high quality environmental performance at its given scale. 
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="solo left medium">Research Innovation </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                Research is integral to developing architecture that can respond to a rapidly changing world, capture our past and also build new knowledge and capabilities in our field. This award designates the project which best explored novel fields of knowledge, whether through measured experimentation, design exploration or scholarly investigation.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="solo left medium">Design Computation</p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                Computation presents new processes, capabilities and even languages to define architecture. The computation award is targeted at projects that have developed their own digital tools, applied novel algorithms to design problems or effectively integrated computational logic into their design.   
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="solo left medium">Social Innovation</p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                Architecture has a profound effect on how society operates, as space is the context and affordance for almost all activities in our lives. This award commends the project which addresses social issues in novel or inspiring ways, while demonstrating links between careful design and positive impacts for society.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="solo left medium">Future Manufacturing</p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                This award designates the most progressive and highly developed thesis addressing the physical construction of architecture. It aims to encourage the use of advanced thinking, methods and design for the fabrication process with consideration of new materials, technologies and/or automation.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="solo left medium">Best Representation</p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                Voted by the combined MArch student body and ASD Faculty to be conferred upon the project which best coveys its thesis and architectural resolution through both conventional media of drawings and models and/or through emerging digital media.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="solo left medium">DP Architects Design Excellence Award </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bottom solo left">
                This award is given to the thesis project which the ASD faculty collectively deem to be the most exemplary project of the year in its reflection of the values and strengths of the MArch programme, and the exceptional effort and achievement of the student.
