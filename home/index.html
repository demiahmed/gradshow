                SUSTAINABLE FUTURES is the theme of the 2021 SUTD Master of Architecture final exhibition review. Sustainability requires our renewed attention in a time of climate change and pandemic. In 2021, SUTD is announcing its first sustainability plan and Singapore is launching a transformative Green Plan. Growing international momentum for action on sustainability has been punctuated by the COP26 climate change conference and the ‘code red’ raised by in the IPCC’s sixth assessment report. 
                <br><br>
                Envisioning sustainable futures is a task our SUTD MArch students are prepared for as designers, critical thinkers and as citizens. Our students are empowered by a self-motivated and research-intensive approach to the MArch. Their research topics germinate over a structured internship, develop into problem statements during thesis preparation term, and are articulated as designs in the thesis term. As you will see in these pages, our students combine expansive architectural design capabilities with the critical mindset and ability to test their claims by gathering, generating, understanding, and communicating data. 

                In 2021 our MArch students engaged sustainability early on in their thesis preparation: we hosted a master class and lecture on Sustainability over the summer of 2021 with John Hong, Professor at Seoul National University, and Director of Project: Architecture. The masterclass followed upon seminar discussions on the writings of William McDunough, Ian McHarg, and Buckminster Fuller and other visionaries that connected the worlds of architecture, design, and sustainability. While not all explicitly tackle sustainability, each student has joined these discussions and developed their unique thesis projects in the context of the theme.
                <br><br>
                We welcome you to browse student projects through our <a href="../explore/" >"Explore Page"</a>, which tracks all student projects by the Sustainable Development Goals they have addressed and permits broader exploration of the diverse projects by topic, scale, location, and faculty mentor. A <a href="../projects">"Projects Page"</a> will allow you to see a full list of our students’ projects. 
                <br><br>
                Please also visit our <a href="https://asd.sutd.edu.sg/programme/master-of-architecture/">"SUTD MArch Overview"</a> to learn more about our programme.
                <br><br>
                We hope that you will enjoy the projects and that we can recruit your support for our next generation of architects as they make their own pathways to creating a better and more sustainable world by design.

            <div class="desc">
              <p>
                This past year, COVID has taken the world by storm.
                Lives were disrupted, the unimaginable became the new norm,
                the usual became taboo, the future became now.
                As we emerge from this unprecedented time, the bamboo offers us a valuable lesson.
                Resilience.
                <br><br>
                In questioning the times we are in, we ask:
                <br><br>
                 What are we doing?<br>
                 How are we doing?<br>
                 Why are we doing?<br>
                 Are we changing?<br>
                 Are we not changing?
                <br><br>
                In questioning resilience, we present the manifestations of the
                different interpretations through the M.Arch Class of 2020’s dialogues and designs.
                <br><br>
                Resilient Futures is the theme for the 2020 Master of Architecture Thesis showcase.
                With a ‘Research Praxis’ focus, it envisions how, through research design,
                technology and society, we can build a new future from the occurrences in 2020.
                In multiple narratives, our students present works from a range of restorative,
                adaptive, restive and transformative architecture.
                Sustainability and technology remain the twin thrusts underlying all projects.

            <p>
                Some of our students have been studying Bamboo and how it can help create architecture,
                to shape an environment.
                The bamboo is the fastest growing plant in the world;
                it can grow up to forty inches within a twenty-four hour time frame.
                The bamboo is a symbol of longevity; it survives the harshest of conditions,
                bending with the wind but never breaking, capable of adapting to any circumstance.
                <br><br>
                In life as in architecture, the spirit of the bamboo relates to our conditions,
                as our graduates embark on their professional journey,
                may they not forget about the bamboo.
                The future holds myriad possibilities, given the foundations they have at SUTD,
                I am confident that they will do well.
                Congratulations to M.Arch Class of 2020, here is wishing you all the best!
