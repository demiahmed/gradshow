    <title-text title="BORDERLAND: Energy Settlement On The Contested Land"></title-text>

    <project-bio
    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="Border and territory are always a highly contested topic between countries.
		Despite both Malaysia and Sinagpore are highly interdependent in trades, energy,water and human resources, political tension between the countries aggrevate over the years.
		How can we transform the stagnant frontier into a commonground for interaction at the same time a productive zone for both nations?

    <br><br>
		As of today, Singapore exploration on renewble energy is limited to the use of solar energy.
		With the extended frontier, how can alternative renewable energy can be introduced into the energy mix for both Malaysia and Singapore.
		On top of that, renewable energy architecture is either monofunction or being implemented as an accessory to a building.
		With “Form follow Energy”, how renewable energy can be used as core design principle to explore how community activity can coexist in this extroterritorial zone.


    <br><br>
    		In the thesis, I will explore the potential to activate the contested border into an energy farming settlement that will help to achieve Sg and Msia sustainability goals. With the settlement acting like a zipper to close and bridge the difference from both sides, it also aims to create a safe platform for exchange to take place without compromising the border condition."
    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="As a student that spend almost 9 years crossing the border between Singapore and Malaysia, the bilateral relationship of this 2 nations has always been an interest of me.
		I would like to use this opportunity to explore the potential of this hinterland at the border and transform it into a productive zone that will sustain the future growth of the countries."

    title="Johor Straits"
    text="Johor straits is the maritime border that is separating Singapore and Malaysia. As a result of the various historical events, the maritime underwent a lot of changes, from an international border to a subnational border and finally back to an international border in 1965.
    Admist this volatile bilateral relationship, there are two birdges across the johor straits, providing physical connection between Singapore and Malaysia. "

    title="Zoning of the Straits"
    text="Zone 1, where the current and wind speed is the highest, this zone will be suitable for the implementation of all three energy harvesting facility, the wind ,wave and solar energy. On top of that, this zone is also comparatively larger than the other zone, hence it will be a suitable area for a consolidated on-site office as well as an accommodation for on-site workers.

    <br><br>
    Zone 2 will be a combination between solar and wind energy. This zone proximity to the main connection between the two countries, makes zone 2 the prefect region for public engagement, and educational tour on the systems that will govern the new straits.
    <br><br>
    Lastly in zone 3, it will be a combination of solar and wave energy. As the zone is close to Coney Island and Pulau Ubin, it opens up the potential for a water recreational zone. On top of that, the zone can also tap on the existing sailing zone to further expand the region and create a potential network of on-water activity.

    title="2nd Link Bridge as Test Site"
    text="The focus for this thesis will be on zone 1, where on top of maximising energy harvestation and developing its supporting facility, the 2nd link bridge connection between Malaysia and Singapore opens up the potential to introduce public facility that can engage visitors and daily travellers across the bridge.
    <br><br>
    Housing 700 modules, this zone alone is able to generate up to 1400 MW, easily fulfilling Singapore 2030 green goal of 1200 MW."

    title="ENergy MODule"
    text="As the johor straits experience equatorial climate, the renewable energy (RE) potential of the straits will be SOLAR energy, WIND energy and WAVE energy.
    With the RE source identiied, the three energy system will then be fused into one energy tower, acting as the base module for the subsequent prototypes.
    This will an overall massing of the base module, Wave energy element submerged underwater -15m, wind turbine placed at 60m, to capture the higher wind speed at the top, and then transition to a flat solar field at 95m. "

    text="PROTOTYPE A will be an iteration of base mod, which will be the secondary module in the paired arrangement. Wide span solar panel are removed and replaced with a larger wind turbine so that the module can take full advantage of the downstream wind generated by the first module.
    <br><br>
    PROTOTYPE B will be an energy tower integrated with public programme that expose visitors to the new system that will be governing the Johor straits. Green deck also provide open green space for gathering between visitors form Malaysia and Singapore.
    <br><br>
    Module C will be a processing module that will help to facilitate on-site worker in managing the zone. To minimize the draft wind which might the functionality of drone, the processing module will only have solar and wave energy.
    <br>
    This module will help to consolidate the electricity generated from all the modules, before transporting back to the land. This module will also be the base camp for remote monitoring of the zone using drone."
