    <title-text title="ENERGY BORDER: <br> <i> <b> Transnational Development at Singapore and Malaysia Frontier </i> </b> "></title-text>

    <project-bio
    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="Border and territory are always a contested topic between countries.
    Despite both Malaysia and Singapore are highly interdependent in trades, energy, water and human resources, political tension between the countries aggravates over the years.
    How can we transform the stagnant frontier into a common ground for interaction at the same time a productive zone for both nations?

    <br><br>
		As of today, Singapore exploration on renewable energy is limited to the use of solar energy.
    With the extended frontier, how can alternative renewable energy be introduced into the energy mix for both Malaysia and Singapore.
    On top of that, renewable energy architecture is either monofunctional or being implemented as an accessory to a building.
    With the ideology of <i><b><b> “Form follow Energy” </i></b></b>, this thesis aims to explore the use of renewable energy system as the core design principle to explore how community activity can coexist in this extraterritorial zone.

    <br><br>
    In the thesis, I will explore the potential to <i><b><b> activate the contested backwater </i></b></b>,
    transforming it into an energy farming settlement that will help to achieve Singapore and Malaysia sustainability goals.
    With the settlement acting like a zipper to close and bridge the difference from both sides,
    it also aims to create a safe platform for exchange to take place without compromising the border condition.

    content="Johor straits is the maritime border that separates Singapore and Malaysia. As a result of the various historical events, the maritime border underwent a lot of changes, from an international border to a subnational border and lastly back to an international border in 1965.
    Amidst this volatile bilateral relationship, there are two bridges across the Johor Straits, providing physical connection between Singapore and Malaysia.
    <br><br>
    With the constant competition over the maritime border, the once thriving shipping route has become the backwater for both nations.
    Taking clue from UN 7th Sustainable Development Goals, 'Affordable and Clean Energy', as well as Singapore 2030 Green Plan and Johor Sustainable Development Plan 2030,
    the 'backwater' Johor Straits presents a strong potential in housing an energy farming settlement that could aid in the nations' sustainability plan."> </text-only> -->

    <text-only title="Zoning of the Straits"
    content="After analysing the current speed and wind speed at Johor straits, the straits are divided into 3 zones of different themes.
    <br><br>
    Zone 1, where the current and wind speed is the highest, this zone will be suitable for the implementation of all three energy harvesting facility, the wind, wave and solar energy. On top of that, this zone is also larger than the other zone, hence it will be a suitable area for a consolidated on-site office as well as an accommodation for on-site workers.
    <br><br>
    Zone 2 will be a combination between solar and wind energy. This zone proximity to the main connection between the two countries, makes zone 2 the prefect region for public engagement, and educational tour on the systems that will govern the new straits.
    <br><br>
    Lastly in zone 3, it will be a combination of solar and wave energy. As the zone is close to Coney Island and Pulau Ubin, it opens up the potential for a water recreational zone. On top of that, the zone can also tap on the existing sailing zone to further expand the region and create a potential network of on-water activity.">

    content="The focus for this thesis will be on zone 1, where on top of maximising energy harvestation and developing its supporting facility, the 2nd link bridge connection between Malaysia and Singapore opens up the potential to introduce public facility that can engage visitors and daily travellers across the bridge.
    <br><br>
    As the wind speed is rather consistent across the area, placement of the module will be determined by the wave condition, where
    water with higher wave speed and wave height is preferred for wave energy generation.
    <br><br>
    Housing 700 modules, this zone alone can generate up to 1400 MW, which will take up 70% of Singapore 2030 green goal of 2000 MW.">

    <br><br>
    Inspired by schooling fish, the energy modules are arranged in pairs, where both drag and energy loss is minimized, resulting in a more efficient large-scale propagation of the modules.
    The iteration of the base mod (far right), will be the secondary module in the paired arrangement. Wide span solar panel are removed and replaced with a larger wind turbine so that the module can take full advantage of the downstream wind generated by the first module."

    <text-only title="Phased Transformation"
    content= " Phase I : Starting from the two land connections between Singapore and Malaysia, energy modules and underwater pipe will start to populate the area progressively.
    <br><br>
    Phase II : By 2030, the Johor Straits will no longer be the stagnant backwater. It will be the powerhouse for renewable energy harvestation that can double the nations' 2030 sustainability goals.
    <br><br>
    Phase III : In 2040, the governments are more accepting to the idea of a shared frontier. This allows more productive programme such as closed loop aquaculture cultivation,
    ecotourism, and a network of water sports to be injected to Johor Straits.
    This transforms the straits from a hinterland, to a regional energy grid. This extended metropolitan region will not only help to sustain life back on mainland,
    it will also be a symbol of the binational ties between Malaysia and Singapore.
