    main-title="Thesis Statement"
    summary="Contemporary urban Transit Oriented Developments (TOD) are presented as the most efficient option for redeveloping dense cities - in that it provides greatest access to mobility to localized areas of greatest density; or conversely that it seeks to locate greatest density at points with mobility access. These developments however frequently take the form of large-scale mega-structures defined by the top-down logic of city planning.  
In contrast, smaller neighborhood-focused, bottom-up planning results in exponential economic growth and the formation of an intricate sociocultural structure.
In China, one distinct example is the urban village - which is ‘self-built,’ without governmental regulation, architects or master plans.
<br><br>  
This thesis questions the purported efficiency of large-scale TOD as a driver to provide optimal access of mobility for the most people - and seeks to valorize the possible contributions of a bottom-up approach similar to urban villages."

    title="What is Transit-Oriented Development(TOD)?" 
    text="TOD is a  planning and design strategy to ensure compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-and bicycle-friendly, and suitably dense urban development organized around transit stations. TOD embraces the idea that locating amenities, jobs, shops, and housing around transit hubs promotes transit usage and nonmotorized travel. Well-planned TOD is inclusive and integrate resilience to natural hazards. "

	title="What is an Urban Village?" 
    text="An urban village is an urban development typically characterized by medium-density housing, mixed use zoning, good public transit and an emphasis on pedestrianization and public space. Diagram at the bottom explains the formation of an urban village. Started off with a small plot of land surrounded by large farming land, new housing is required by the influx of migrant workers under a booming economy. 
Rapid urbanization caused the rural areas at the outskirts to be occupied by the city gradually. As a result, more and more high-rise and office towers are built on the site of urban village, threatening the existence of the ‘village in the city’.
What does this mean in the future, will urban village disappear completely, or should we find ways to have a balance between the two?

They are narrow, mostly less than 2-meter in width, there is no demarcation between pedestrians, bicycles and cars. There are eateries and lifestyle shops located on the ground floor and residential units on top, residents can fulfill their daily requirements conveniently without leaving the vicinity. However, there is little, or no space designated for people to hang out and relax. "

    title="Master Plan Proposals" 
    text="The first three master plan proposals looks at different way of organizing the network and green spaces within the neighborhood to achieve a better public transit system and introducing vibrancy and energy into the compact urban village.
A series of design operations are described as following for the first three iterations, based on the existing streets, I first widened them to 10-meter for bicycle and pedestrian network around the periphery. And 5-meter for pedestrian only network within. Followed by removing blocks interfering with the streets and lastly bring back the removed residential units by proposing new locations for taller residential blocks
Number of dwelling units removed, and number of dwelling units added by the proposed new taller buildings are calculated to evaluate the suitability of the master plan.
Different from the first three proposals, the second set of master plan introduces more pedestrian network for better integration.The last set of master plan introduced a central green space

Annual radiation analysis on the right shows that the existing sunlight condition is dark, and buildings are closely packed. There is no sufficient sunlight for growing plants and this in turn discourages urban activities.  "

    text="The final master plan showing the introduction of different activity zones. An annual radiation analysis is carried out on the final proposed master plan.
After widening the roads and opening up for green space. The space is more open and offers green relief for people, sufficient sunlight for growing plants and facilitates urban activities.
The main goal is to improve the quality of urban public space, revitalize street life and extend and improve the macro network of public transport with micro network of interconnected streets and public space.
With reference to the current government planning strategy on other urban village regeneration, it takes an approximately three years for completion.

As such, by repurposing the rooftops, this allows me to capitalize on the untapped spatial resource to introduce more life and vibrancy in the neighborhood. First ideation is a vertical rooftop park. This creates a great diversity of spaces: spaces where people can meet up and spaces for relaxation."
