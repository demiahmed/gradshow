    main-title="Summary"
    summary="With increasing globalization, people around the world are becoming more present on online platforms.  With gadgets improving day by day, we can see a drastic rise in the number of people gaining access to the internet across a wide variety of interfaces: on their mobile phones, laptops and tablets. Access to virtual reality has become a necessity rather than a privilege in recent times.
    <br><br>  
    In light of the the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on society, we are subconsciously called to reconsider the means society behaves and function as technology develops and we strive for a sustainable tomorrow. As we endeavor to bring about future-proof designs, we strove to adapt and answer to the key work-live paradigm shifts that we have identified: 
	<br><br>
	1. How the boundaries of work spaces have been redefined, in which we are no longer conformed to conventional workspaces? 
	<br><br>
	2. How can business adapt to the post-pandemic consumer behaviours?
	<br><br>
	3. How supply sources and logistical lines can implement enhanced safety measures to ensure smooth mobility of their goods? 
	<br><br>
	4. And the apparent need for the workforce to develop specialized skills as we move towards a high digitized era.

    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="Hi there, my name is Adler Teo and at this moment, I am a Master's student in the Singapore University of Technology & Design. My major in Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) trains me to become a forward looking designer with a strong focus towards building for the future. 

    <br><br>          
    In my practice as a student architect, I work towards creating spatial designs that are sensitive to humans while envisioning and working towards future-proof designs. I am constantly looking for the aesthetic of the present while integrating it with concepts of the future. Kindly enjoy my thesis proposal titled 'The New Paradigm for Commerce: The Facade of Retail in a Pandemic Setting'."

    text="Before we launch into ideas of the future, let's begin with understanding the current situation.
	The proposal is focused on the recreation of existing port cranes into Drone Towers of the Future. The culmination of the research seeks to embrace e-commerce as an up and rising industry of the future, of which the towers will serve as enablers within a technology driven campus to facilitate provision of various services in the digital age, as we look to better equip society for future needs.
	<br><br>
	Analyzing the trends on E-commerce, we begin to observe the unique traits of the industry that has allowed it to surface within the last decade. Specifically, we can see that the growing levels of technology born from the digital era has enabled multiple means for the e-commerce industry to leverage on their success. 
	<br><br>
	Furthermore, technology has enabled unique means of marketing through visually aesthetic forms never dreamed before, such as through virtual or augmented reality. From these, we can start to consider the endless potential of this industry for the future.

    title="Industry of the Future" 
    text="Moving on from the big picture, we now look specifically within our region. 
	<br><br>
	A majority of the top 10 fastest e-commerce growing countries hail from within the Asia-Pacific region. We can also look forward to sustainable long term growth as well as potential global consumer base where we tap on e-commerce giants like Taobao and Ali-express in regional China for potential partnerships and collaborative cooperation.
	<br><br>
	Extrapolating from these trends, Singapore is viewed to be technologically favored and structurally capable of setting itself as a global e-commerce trading hub within the South East Asian region."

    title="A New Normal"
    text="The Covid 19 pandemic has brought about a long and lasting impact on Singapore, creating ripples in almost every part of society and fundamentally changing the way we perceive the workspace. It has emphasized how commerce can be conducted without the need of a physical storefront - challenging the concept of traditional trade within this age of digitalization. Fundamentally showing how e-commerce or rather contactless trade could be the solution or even a new normal for the future. "

    title="Redevelopment Framework"
    text="This brings us to our proposal proper, where we look into providing 2 design-oriented solutions.
	<br><br>
	Firstly, the adaptive reuse of existing shipping cranes to create drone towers that will revolutionize commerce for the future, facilitating various service-based industries using autonomous aerial vehicles. 
	<br><br>
	Secondly, embracing e-commerce as a platform to create a unique campus which serves as a one-stop destination for all e-commerce related businesses, as well as an incubator for the industry on local grounds. This is actualized through a master plan of the existing port site where we envision a framework of related programmes as well as certain technologies that are still evolving and not yet established.
