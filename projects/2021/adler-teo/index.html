    summary="Analysing the trends on E-commerce, we begin to observe the unique traits of the industry that has allowed it to surface within the last decade. Specifically we can see that the growing levels of technology born from the digital era has enabled multiple means for the e-commerce industry to leverage on their success.
    <br><br>  
    With increasing globalization, people around the world are becoming more present on online platforms, ever improving technology provides the interface in terms of mobile laptops or phones to access online stores as well as unique means of marketing through visually aesthetic forms via virtual or augmented reality." 
    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="Hi there, my name is Adler Teo and at this moment, I am a Master's student in the Singapore University of Technology & Design. My major in Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD) trains me to become a forward looking designer with a strong focus towards building for the future. 

     <br><br>          
     In my practice as a student architect, I work towards creating spatial designs that are sensitive to humans while envisioning and working towards future-proof designs. I am constantly looking for the aesthetic of the present while integrating it with concepts of the future. Kindly enjoy my thesis proposal titled 'The New Paradigm for Commerce: The Facade of Retail in a Pandemic Setting'."

    title="Industry of the Future" 
    text="Looking specifically within our region, we can see that we bear the fastest growth within Asia-Pacific, with sustainable long term growth as well as the potential of a global consumer base where we have e-commerce giants like Taobao and Ali-express in regional China. Extrapolating from these trends, Singapore is technologically and structurally capable of setting itself as a global e-commerce trading hub within the SEA region. "

    title="The Pandemic Hustle"
    text="The covid 19 pandemic has brought about a long and lasting impact on Singapore, creating ripples in almost every part of society and fundamentally changing the way we perceive the workspace. It has emphasized how commerce can be conducted without the need of a physical storefront - challenging the concept of traditional trade within this age of digitalization. Fundamentally showing how e-commerce or rather contactless trade could be the solution or even a new normal for the future. "

    title="2021:Paradigm Shift" 
    text="To summarize the paradigm shift brought about by the Pandemic, we look at a few key points of relevance:
	<br><br>
	1. How the boundaries of work spaces have been re-defined, no longer conformed to conventional workspaces
	<br><br>
	2. How businesses have to adapt to post-pandemic consumer behaviours 
	<br><br>
	3. And the last 2 points more relevant to e-commerce in specific, where enhanced safety measures are put into place to ensure smooth mobility of goods and transparency between consumers and businesses"
