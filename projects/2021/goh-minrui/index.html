    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Public housing in Singapore has evolved to a design for maximum privacy, unintentionally resulted in discouraging interaction between neighbours. This presented a society that values our independence and autonomy, more than our connection with others. More can be done to our built environment to facilitate individuals engagement with neighbours and society.
    <br><br>  
    Data from around the modern world show a spike in loneliness among the young as well as the old. Social isolation can trigger or exacerbate mental health disorders in individuals. The prevalence of social isolation is increasing, especially with a global trend of living alone, and an increasing aging population, the two most susceptible groups to social isolation. 
    <br><br>  
    The thesis aims to evaluate the current design of housing units in Singapore and reconfigure living spaces to tackle mental health problems prevalent in society today, with the main focus on alleviating social isolation."

    title="Current situation" 
    text="Through the years, the focus of HDB has led to the design of blocks and estates to evolve towards maximising occupants' privacy. The void deck was designed as a flexible space to encourage community interactions. However, addition of metal barricades prevent residents from using the space, effectively going against its original intent. Youths are no longer able to have a space to play ball games sheltered from weather, and on the right, elderly are not allowed to sit or rest comfortably on the provided platform.
    <br><br>
    Waterway Terraces in Punggol was studied as a precedent. It was awarded BCA green mark platinum certification with many sustainable strategies incorporated for passive climatic control and renewable energy. However, the design may not be optimal to encourage social interaction between neighbours. The following images illustrate are some deficiencies observed during a site visit.
    <br><br>
    Awkwardly angled lift cores are situated at a distance from units and will not be activated as a space for social use. Narrow double loaded corridors branching out have bulky concrete fins lining up both sides allow for airing ventilation, but not natural daylight to permeate. This emphasizes that the communal areas are merely for circulation. Communal spaces have limited equipment and are poorly maintained. The lack of users in communal areas either show poorly designed spaces, or that the spaces are not suited for the demographics present. not-as-successful examples can teach us mistakes to avoid and not repeat."

    title="Background"
    text="Having analysed HDB housing through the decades, the focus of the thesis is to redesign a housing estate, with the primary intention to provide living spaces targeted for our social and mental wellbeing. By extracting qualities from both the slab block and point block, a new typology is proposed, with added central void for increased air and light quality.
    <br><br>
    The thesis is targeting to resolve a global social issue through architectural means, the proposed solution can be projected into other cities of similar weather temperament. 
    <br><br>For purposes of this thesis, a site in Singapore is chosen for a more targeted intervention. For the project to be replicable elsewhere, the chosen site should fit the following criteria:
    <br><br>-Located in a residential town (availability of community)
    <br><br>-Accessible (well connected to transportation network)
    <br><br>-Does not have any site specific unique features (surrounded by mid-rise buildings)
