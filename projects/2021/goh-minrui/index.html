    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Through the years, the function and definition of our home has broadened. Home is no longer just the place we live and rest; but also where we work, learn, and exercise, with our loved ones. Home is a feeling of belonging.
    <br><br>  
    Yet, as more and more people stay within the boundaries of their comfort space, we lose our connection with others as social beings, increasing the prevalence of social isolation, the lack of interpersonal connection and interaction with society.  
    <br><br>  
    The thesis aims to evaluate the current design of housing units in Singapore and reconfigure living spaces to tackle mental health problems prevalent in society today, with the main focus on alleviating social isolation."

    <b> CURRENT OBSERVATIONS </b>
    <br><br>  
    Through the years, the focus of HDB has led to the design of blocks and estates to evolve towards maximising occupants' privacy. The void deck was designed as a flexible space to encourage community interactions. However, addition of metal barricades prevent residents from using the space, effectively going against its original intent. Youths are no longer able to have a space to play ball games sheltered from weather, and on the right, elderly are not allowed to sit or rest comfortably on the provided platform.

    A near neighbour is better than a brother far off.

    title="Site Criteria"
    text="Having analysed HDB housing through the decades, the focus of the thesis is to redesign a housing estate, with the primary intention to provide living spaces targeted for our social and mental wellbeing. By extracting qualities from both the slab block and point block, a new typology is proposed, with added central void for increased air and light quality.
    <br><br>
    The thesis is targeting to resolve a global social issue through architectural means, the proposed solution can be projected into other cities of similar weather temperament. 
    <br><br>For purposes of this thesis, a site in Singapore is chosen for a more targeted intervention. For the project to be replicable elsewhere, the chosen site should fit the following criteria:
    <br><br>-Located in a residential town (availability of community)
    <br><br>-Accessible (well connected to transportation network)
    <br><br>-Does not have any site specific unique features (surrounded by mid-rise buildings)

    title="UNITE VILLAGE"
    text=" <b> UNITE </b> is a modern interpretation of a village, connecting residential units and social amenities through linking corridors and ‘backyards’. 
    <br><br>By strategically scattering communal amenities through the estate, <b> UNITE </b> aims to increase residents’ awareness of each other and thereafter the opportunity of incidental meetings.
    <br><br>
    <br><br> <b> MODULES </b>
    <br><br>Common amenities designed for social connection possibilities can also be plugged into these module spaces, giving residents the opportunity for multiple socialisation to occur as they wander across villages to use shared spaces and cross paths with each other, an approach to identify, recognise, and connect with the community they reside in.

    <b> SITE PLACEMENT </b>
    <br><br>  
    Villages are placed on site and propagated in a checkerbox formation. This forms a massing with courtyards, for vertical circulation through the village, and courtyards for residential units facing inward. Since villages connect to each other at a point, additional access linkages will be then inserted to link villages horizontally on each floor.
