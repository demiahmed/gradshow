    <title-text title="AGROPOLIS: Reimagining Urban Food Security"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="The increasing densification of urban populations, rising costs of living, and the acceleration of a changing climate has driven a social awareness for environmental issues, and the need for sustainable lifestyles. Conventional food production is confronted with the loss of arable land, diminishing fresh water supplies, and disruptions to the global supply chain. The need to <i>strengthen food security</i> has driven cities to incorporate agricultural production into their urban landscape.
	<br><br>
	This thesis re-examines <i>sustainable urban agriculture</i> by first understanding the importance of food security in Singapore, where food is a key part of its cultural identity, and its geopolitical context has enabled it to become a hotbed for food production innovation, supported by its goal to produce 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030. 
	<br><br>
	Current agricultural approaches are focused on high productivity using smart technologies, such as climate-controlled environments and robotics. While useful in supplying markets with fresh produce, such methods of designing a <i>“black box farm”</i>  intensifies the need for energy-hungry systems to sustain growing cities. It also disconnects communities from intimate relationships between people and their food, a key opportunity in fostering <i>food conscious communities</i>. By looking at the limitations of existing solutions, fundamental ideas behind urban agriculture will be challenged. Stakeholders must recognise the premise of long-term sustainable agriculture through intelligently designed spaces and phased expansion, a proposition which is becoming increasingly urgent in today’s climate.
	<br><br>
	Instead of seeking methods that maximise agricultural output at all costs, a new architectural paradigm focused on </i>low-energy processes and circular systems<i> is proposed. Architecture can complement agriculture in looking beyond Singapore’s 2030 target. In designing for urban food security, integrated designs can go beyond feeding future generations and cultivate ties between communities and their food."

    title="Singaporeans enjoy their food. But do they value it?" 
    text="Singapore’s cultural identity is heavily rooted in its food. Everyone loves a good plate of hawker food, from char kyaw teow and wanton mee, to nasi lemak and chicken briyani. But most don't think about the amount of ingredients inside each dish, and the distances they travel to get on the plate. Singapore produces less than 10% of its own food items, limited to eggs, fish and vegetables. The other 90% is imported from one of many countries around the world, from regional neighbours in ASEAN and Asia, but also from as far as Brazil and the United States. 
	<br><br>
	The unremitting trends of growing populations, diminishing water supply, urbanization and climate change have contributed to the decline of arable land per person. Rising demand and flat supplies have rekindled the debate over whether production can keep up with population. The over-reliance of import-oriented countries on other countries for food becomes a risk when there is insufficient supply. Technology and specialization have allowed countries to increase farm production by growing monocultures and exporting surplus, but Covid-19 has exposed weak points in the world's food supply chain."

    title="Beefing up food security"
    text="A new initiative aims to increase Singapore's local food production to 30% by 2030. Dubbed “30 by 30”, it is part of the larger Singapore Green Plan, and aims to strengthen food security amidst growing global challenges. Currently, Singapore relies heavily on external food sources, and has begun leveraging on existing industries to improve food security. However, Singapore’s high-density urban environment necessitates land-efficient and highly productive farms."

    <text-image
    image="./data/carlite-wfh.png"
    title="Sustainable town planning"
    text="In addition to sustainable food approaches, Singapore has planned for other green initiatives for the coming decades. Important trends on the rise are car-lite policies, which encourage alternative forms of transport and reduce the strain on road infrastructure. This is coupled with the idea of the 45-minute city, 20-minute town, which aims to improve accessibility to amenities and reduce travel distances. 
	<br><br>
	Additionally, the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new work-from-home and home-based-learning policies, which decentralises the office and results in more time spent around the home. All these measure aim to reduce travelling, specifically via private cars. With fewer cars, there is less need for road infrastructure sucha as parking spaces needed, which can be repurposed for other needs."

	<p style="margin:0em 25em;">Thus, to take advantage of these policies, the opportunity presents itself in repurposing car parks into urban agriculture spaces within Singapore’s public housing neighbourhoods, where 80% of the population reside. To achieve the “30 by 30” goal, up to 51 multi-storey car parks could be repurposed into commercial farming spaces. Considering that there are over 900 of these car parks around Singapore, 51 is a small fraction. So could we go further? The 2030 target is only a touchpoint, and more can be done in the following years to bolster Singapore’s food security.

    title="Selecting sites"
    text="A collection of sites must be selected from the 932 datapoints. The objective was to identify a set of typical sites with similar characteristics, which allows for the implementation with minimal redesign. This would allow for the implementation of architectural strategies to connect people with food, which can then propagated throughout a series of subsequent sites, becoming a network of HDB neighbourhood food hubs around Singapore. A computational analysis was chosen to quickly narrow down the selection. A series of quantitative and qualitative criteria, such as car park orientation and footprint typicalness was used to parametrically score all the sites."

    title="Prototypical site selection"
    text="Based on the results, three sites were chosen for further study. The three sites are located in Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Tampines, which all are large, mature HDB estates. The primary test site chosen is at Lorong 4 Toa Payoh, and will be the focus for the initial prototypical design."

	<p style="margin:5em 18em 0em 18em;">A key feature of car parks is the gridded layout, whose dimensions are based on parking lot dimensions and driving clearances. This means that all HDB multi-storey car parks are built upon a similar grid system, advantageous for repeatable designs. Thus, a modular approach is favoured to ensure the same design approach can be used on different car parks. Solar analysis was conducted to understand annual rooftop solar irradiation, a key factor for agriculture. The southern half of the site receives less sunlight, due to the tall point blocks on either side. Thus, placing more growing space on the northern half would ensure crops can receive more sunlight. Using modules based on the grid system, a series of blocks were aggregated to form an initial farm massing. This height and depth ensures that crops can receive as much sunlight as possible, while also ensuring sufficient grow area to achieve production capacity.

    title="Reinforcing the existing structure"
    text="With such a large mass proposed, reinforcing the existing structure must be considered to support the weight of the commercial farm. A structural reinforcement strategy was developed, taking advantage of the existing structure and grid system. This extends through all the floors of the structure, and aligned to the grid, minimizing impact on lower floors, where parking and community programmes will be implemented."

    title="Whole system approach"
    text="Internal programmes are selected based on community-centred food concepts, from production to waste management. These programmes are viewed together as a whole system, to better understand resource utilisation and reduce waste. It encompasses water recycling, food waste management, and knowledge loops. Additional programmes are identified which complement the system and create circular loops, such as aquaponic fish tanks to clean crop water runoff, and mushroom cultivation for waste recycling and additional produce."

    text="A series of modules are being developed using the same grid as a base. It forms a kit of parts which can adapt to various car parks shapes. Only the agriculture modules are shown, but the kit of parts will include all internal programmes, ranging from supporting spaces for farming such as water storage and packing, as well as public programmes like the farmer’s market, and cafes. For example, the grow modules for the commercial farm contain grow trays which rotate around to ensure crops receive even sunlight."

	<p style="margin:0em 18em 0em 18em;">To ensure a successful transition into sustainable community lifestyles, a three phased approach is proposed. The first phase sees the addition of the commercial farm, replacing the upper deck with commercial and public programmes. Food-oriented amenities such as farmer’s market, along with the aquaponics fish tanks and food packing are located below the rooftop level. The ground floor is use for F&B spaces and food waste systems. This forms the main hub, a seed planted within the community. 
	<br><br>
	The second phase integrates the food hub with neighbouring blocks, by introducing community gardens and elevated linkways. Car parking is gradually reduced, creating more space for community programmes. By now, the establishment of the commercial farm in Phase 1 would ensure a wealth of contextual farming knowledge, to be passed onto the community. This availability of expertise and proximity to garden space hopes to cultivate awareness of food production. 
	<br><br>
	The last phase looks at how individual households can take up their own urban agriculture practices, by encouraging household gardening. By phasing this last, residents would have gained a deeper appreciation for the natural systems behind what they eat, maybe even grown up with it being the norm. This encourages them to make sustainable lifestyle choices, the last step in long-term food security.

    ></image-image>
	
	<p style="margin:0em 18em 0em 18em;">
	Circular systems are seen throughout the design concept. Water recycling and food production cycle are key in ensuring waste is minimized and allows the food hub to contribute back to the community. Harvested rainwater is used for crops, cleaned via the aquaponics systems, and recirculated through the building. Vegetable produce is distributed to the farmer’s market and F&B outlets, and the resulting food waste is broken down in the digester, along with food waste from the surrounding HDB blocks. This converts it into compost, used for mushroom cultivation. Leftover mushroom substrate is mixed with compost to fertilize crops.
	<br><br>
	The repurposing of HDB multi-storey car parks also demonstrates circularity, taking advantage of existing infrastructure and extending the lifecycle of the building. Using a kit of parts for programmatic layouts also ensures spaces can be easily fabricated and transported to various sites, with the potential to be plug-and-play, or even be able to hot-swap across various food hubs.

	In Summary
	</h3>
	<p style="margin:0px 400px 0px 400px; text-align: center;">
	AGROPOLIS envisions a <i>decentralised network of food hubs</i> throughout Singapore’s public housing estates, built upon existing multistorey HDB car parks. The integration food production with public spaces, taking advantage of car-lite initiatives and adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure, allows for a compact layout which can be replicated across multiple neighbourhoods with minimal redesign.
	<br><br>
	<i>Circular systems</i> is demonstrated on multiple levels of architectural design. Rainwater harvesting and water recycling, food waste collection for composting, and localised knowledge loops from commercial farm to residents minimize energy and resource consumption. A modular kit of parts and repurposing of the car park reduces construction and material costs. 
	<br><br>
	Ultimately, this thesis aims to strengthen Singapore’s food security and connect communities with food production. This is achieved through normalising local produce through close proximity to the farming process, exposure to community-led gardens, and <i>phased expansion</i> of farm initiatives. This encourages communities to have a sense of ownership over local food production and cultivates long-term sustainable lifestyles. While this thesis speculates the possibility of neighbourhood food hubs, the architectural and engineering technologies already exist in some form. Through enhanced green policies and strengthened ties between government, industry and communities, the seed has been sown for a more sustainable tomorrow.
