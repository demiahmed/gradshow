    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Cities have always been a topic of contention amongst architects and planners alike in the last few decades. 
    Cities provide infinite possiblities to the metropolitan yet this promise comes at a gargantuan cost. 
    Indiscriminate and ignorant consumption plague almost every city in the world and has contributed to the rise in global temperatures. 
    If left on this trajectory, the world will see a very bleak future for its inhabitants. In line with Rem Koolhaas's recent interest in the countryside, 
    the focus has shifted ever so slightly to the hinterlands where architects should seek to draw lessons from and adapt them into city planning and urban renewal. 
    This thesis design therefore, looks at urban renewal as opposed to the continued expansion of cities to meet the world's needs. The project is situated in Singapore's heartlands, 
    where it explores the resuscitation of the countryside whilst building on existing city infrastructure. The project seeks to imagine a sustainable future that employs 
    the efficiency of cities and the stewardship of resources in the hinterlands."

     title="What Now?" 
     text="A defining feature of the current age is its struggle
     against climate change. It is changing how the
     urban environment is perceived and calls for a
     rethink in the way buildings and cities are designed.
     The metamodern age reflects postmodern
     apathy towards the current condition and the
     modern enthusiasm for something new, driving
     this generation to look to relationships between
     old and new, aesthetics and function, consumerism
     and sustainability. In Turner’s Metamodernist
     Manifesto, he aptly describes this condition
     as a societal reform that is “neither a return to
     zealous commitment (modern) nor a continuation
     of calculated opportunism (postmodern) but
     something else entirely. Perhaps it can be best
     described, in the words of architect Bjarke Ingels,
     as a pragmatic utopianism or, more specifically,
     a sustainable hedonism.”
    
     <br>
     <br>
     This “sustainable hedonism”, or hedonistic
     sustainability is a potentially critical step to
     curbing our emissions and waste through
     designing buildings, cities and systems that
     engages all levels of society, from the individual
     to communities and governments.

     title="Beyond the Metropolis" 
     text="Cities and the countryside have always existed in antagonism with one another, propagating cultural, social, political and environmental issues
     that plague the world today. Whilst cities are the reason why the world is now grappling with the issue
     of climate change, it also part of the solution. With all the ills that the city
     brings, its redemption may well lie its shortcomings too. The efficiency of
     cities is key to the response against climate emergencies, as with epidemics,
     political turmoil and social unrest. It is why they have been the focal point
     for decades in contrast to the countryside.
     Cities are well positioned to act on the improvement of
     resource efficiency, innovating waste management and
     pivoting from pollutive industries.

     <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
     
     This thesis design takes on a speculative vision of urban renewal in Singapore's heartlands, exploring the resuscitation of the countryside whilst building on existing
     city infrastructure. The project seeks to imagine a sustainable future that employs the efficiency of cities and the stewardship of resources in the hinterlands. 
     The Hyper Village is an oscillatory condition between the urban and rural, a ruban community that functions as a complete ecosystem.

    title="Multi-tiered Approach" 
    text="The project seeks to approach climate action and sustainable living by proposing additions to the existing Singapore Green Plan 2030. It takes a bolder stance by looking at achieving ambitious goals through re-evaluating the way cities traditionally approach urban renewal. The key factor is the resuscitation of the countryside in the fully urbanised city-state of Singapore. The motivation behind this is to create prototypical community within a city that can be adapted and repurposed in cities around the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea of the democratisation of ownership is drawn from Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City and is critical in the functioning of the Hyper Village. Traditionally, authorities in the cities are the caretakers of the populace, with little involvment from the people apart from democratic processes like voting. This multi-tiered collaboration that sees partnerships between resident cooperatives, the authorities and the private sector seeks to offer a greater sense of ownership to the residents whilst employing the efficiency of cities in the form of consultation with authorities and leveraging on the profitability of the private sector.

    title="Investigating Productive Typologies" 
    text="These key typologies of productive systems inform the functions of the Hyper Village. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The Sawak Tambak Rice Fish Aquaculture is a popular practice in Java, Indonesia. It is viable for Singapore due to its suitability to lowland ecosystems and its adaptive polyculture provides for multiple streams of food production and enhances the biodiversity as it supports species like ducks, freshwater prawns and frogs.
    <br>
    <br>
    High-tech aquaculture and hydroponic systems produce a drastically higher yield compared to low-tech systems and is more efficient in land-use which is critical for the land-scarce Singapore. Local aquaculture farms like Eco-Ark is able to produce 1660 tonnes of fish per hectare annually which is 790% more yield per hectare compared to traditional aquaculture systems.
    <br>
    <br>
    Localised food processing facilites are important as well as it reduces transport time and reduces the chances of vegetables and seafood from going bad. The close proximity of these facilities to food production centres reduce the carbon footprint induced for transport.

    title="Approaching Urban Form"
    text="The current urban fabric follows Modernist masterplanning rules that are expressed on a single plane, bound by height restrictions in specific zones. 
    This ensuing architectural expression becomes a series of generic blocks, contributing to illegibility of the urban fabric.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The projected Hyper Village masterplan offers a relational approach as opposed to a bounding box through which architects and developers work within. 
    Parametricism offers open-ended compositions through associative logics and give rise to a collective form.
    In achieving this collective form, the expression of materiality and aesthetics must aim to be coherent to maintain legibility as well."

    title="The Hyper Village in Phases"
    text="A network of agri-aquaculture facilities form the core of the Hyper Village. These facilities produce food for consumption and exports using high-tech means.
    Natural landscape is subsequently layered over in addition to rice-fields that provide for food production and active resident participation to promote social inclusivity. 
    Low rise housing populate the center of the oasis while high-rise housing serve as a buffer from the existing urban fabric. Finally the Hyper Village seeks to expand beyond its locality, 
    reinvigorating the heartlands while providing for food and energy."
