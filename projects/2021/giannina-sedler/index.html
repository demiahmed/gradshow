    carbon capture approach for Singapore."></title-text>

    main-title="Summary"
    summary="The effects of the man-driven climate change due to rising CO2 levels are clearer than ever before and represent a global threat to humanity. Intensive research has been conducted on this matter and several technologies that remove existing carbon dioxide emissions or highly reduce new ones are in development and some were already implemented. However, most of these technologies are either specific for pollution sources, what reduces emitted emissions but does not reduce historic emissions, or need a large amount of space, what restricts their locations to this specific factors and not to where they are indeed needed the most, or consume loads of energy, sometimes producing more carbon than what they absorb.
    <br><br> 
    Buildings are large carbon emission contributors since their construction until they are disposed and there is therefore a need for them to contribute in some way to the carbon removal process. Low Hong Yee and Tan Mei Chee, engineers from the EPD (Engineering Product Development) department of SUTD, created a new material that passively absorbs carbon from the air and is as thin as a film. Thanks to its characteristics, C3, how the material was called, can be placed almost everywhere and allows as for a de-centralized carbon capture process.
    <br><br>  
    This thesis will therefore stand in collaboration with EPD and will investigate the potential of integrating carbon capture into architecture utilizing C3. Through the thesis existing technologies will be analysed to see what we can take from them and C3’s constraints and capabilities will be assessed in order to ensure the right conditions for its functionality are met. Singapore’s weather conditions and pollution levels will also be analysed in order to propose a specific carbon capture model that will fit these. Although the use of c3 alone will not solve the emissions problem itself and neither will other technologies on their own, its use can truly make a difference."

    title="C3 tower system" 
    text="As a closed system, the C3 tower will be capable of absorbing CO2 as well as releasing it in a controlled manner to make use of it. In addition, the tower is designed to be self-sufficient and will be able to perform these tasks by utilizing energy produced on-site. 
    <br><br> 
    The C3 films will be placed onto the thick façade (4.5 to 6.5 m), from which they will passively absorb CO2 from the air. Once the films are fully soaked in CO2, they will be transported into the greenhouse located in the middle of the tower by dedicated personnel or via automated “smart” robotic systems. In the greenhouse, C3 will be heated to a specific temperature which will trigger the previously captured carbon dioxide to be released. This process of absorption and release can be repeated up to 30 times before the film’s life cycle comes to an end. The released CO2 will allow the feeding of plants which require a constant CO2 level in the air. At the highest point of the tower, wind speeds reach their maximum and this circumstance will be exploited by installing wind mills for the generation of renewable energy for the towers operations. 
    <br><br> 
    The tower is designed to accommodate as many accessible places as possible. In these public spaces, visitors will be able to learn about the damages that the excessive amounts of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are causing to our planet and how C3 is contributing to solving this problem. High up to tower, they will also enjoy the panoramic and breathtaking views of the sea and Singapore."

    title="Glue-laminated timber structure"
    text="The towers’ structure is made from glue-laminated timber. The thick façade has a varying thickness of 4.5 to 6.5 m, which permits the timber to be used structurally in a high-rise building. In addition, this material is environmentally friendly and can be assembled on site.  
    <br><br> 
    When developing a carbon dioxide capturing system all the embodied carbon that is released in the course of its construction is deducted from the total carbon dioxide absorption. Choosing materials with a high amount of embodied carbon will therefore reduce the systems total CO2 absorption capacity. It is hence essential to not only allow the tower to function in an environmentally friendly way, but to construct it according to its sustainability principles, too."

    <img-caption content="In order to fully function, the C3 film must remain dry and protected from water. For this purpose, a rain shielding mechanism (louver system) was developed. The louvers act normally as an extension of C3 panels and in this way, they allow wind to flow through the tower without interfering with the currents. However, as soon as it starts to rain, the mechanism unfolds, whereby a wall that prevents water from entering the tower is formed.
