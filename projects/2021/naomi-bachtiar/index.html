    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Katakita is a tool for participatory planning. The project rethinks the process of design in a large-scale development project such that the resultant design can be more inclusive. By facilitating the interaction of different stakeholders and giving numerical feedback on different design options, key issues surrounding the development project can be discussed. While Katakita is currently set in the context of MRT development in Jakarta, its methodology can be easily adapted to different contexts." 
    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="I am an aspiring architect / urban designer. I believe that the way we design is as important if not more than the design itself. 
    <br><br>     
    The greatest tool that we have as designers is empathy. A large portion of our time is used to think about how would a user experience a space and and about the social implications of certain design choices. This belief drove me to create Katakita. Translated to 'Our Say', Katakita aims to give a voice to stakeholders of different background. In the future, I hope to see this tool be used in real-world projects."

    title="Abstract: Profitability vs Equitability" 
    text="The ongoing MRT development in Jakarta has the potential to greatly improve mobility. In city which has long faced problems with traffic congestions and poor public transportation system, this MRT development can be key for driving equality. However, it runs the risk of causing displacement for the lower income group.
    <br><br>
    This thesis looks into equitable transit-oriented development through understanding the risk of displacement for the vulnerable communities when a new transit node is introduced. It aims to challenge the typical redensification model which rely upon the demolition of existing infrastructures. Instead, it will explore the possiblity of developing a design process that allow for the introduction of a new transit node to be beneficial for the existing community. 
    In particular, participatory planning process will be explored as a way to drive a community-centric development.
    <br><br>
    As the problem of displacement is strongly linked to financial reasons, this thesis shall explore a design process that can balance the profitability of a project with equitability."

    title="Context" 
    text="Based on the 2020 population census, Jakartaâ€™s population is bottom-heavy with 46.5 percent of the population aged 29 and below. In the next 10-15 years, it is projected that there will be an increase in housing needs especially taking into consideration the influx of people from outside Jakarta who come for better job opportunities. 
    <br><br>
    A haphazard growing model of the city will not cut it. Jakarta needs a concrete plan as to how it might cater to this future need.
    With the ongoing MRT construction, future MRT lines can act as the spine for densification.

    title="Game as a Participatory Design Tool"
    text="Katakita is a game that aims to help stakeholders navigate the complex issues associated with a development project. This function is facilitated by several key features.
    <br><br>
    These features are:
    <ol>
      <li>Multiplayer Support: Game becomes a platform for discussion and collaborative design.</li><br>
      <li>In-game Roles Selection: Allow for stakeholders to understand different perspectives. Faciliates consensus-building.</li><br>
      <li>Real-time Scoring System: Immediate feedback on the impact that different decisions have. i.e. rental values, equitability ratio, total number of displaced people and demolished buildings, total green space, ground coverage.</li>
      <br>
    </ol>"

    title="Setting the Game Board and Pieces"
    text="For site selection, all the slum areas in Jakarta is first mapped. This data is then overlayed with the population density distribution and the planned MRT routes. The site selected is based on the number of population impacted, proximity to the MRT line and their slum-like qualities.
    <br><br>
    After the site is selected, the plots are defined. It is then translated to a 10 x 10m grid to become the game board.
    <br><br>
    The game pieces consist of of a series of standard-sized building modules (10 x 10m) and micro-sized building modules (5 x 5m). Each of these modules will have different values associated to them. These values are relevant for the scoring system"

    title="Further Development"
    text="The game's final design can be saved as a .json file which is then transferred to Rhino3D for further development. The idea is that multiple gameplays can be run in different focus group discussions for the development project. After which, the optimal design based on selected criterias can be chosen.
    <br><br>
    Of course, the result of the game is not a finished design product. Instead, it acts as a baseline for the urban planner to work on. One of the difficulties in comparing between design options is the lack of numerical data that comes with it. Working based on the optimal design can help inform the urban planner of the viability of his/her design.
    <br><br>
    It is also important to note that what is referred to as optimal design is not the absolute optimal design. Instead it is the relative optimal design as compared to other design results arising from the different gameplays. This relative optimal design is perhaps more valuable than an absolute one because there is the user input aspect that cannot be captured purely by numbers. This human touch is what separates Katakita from a simple optimisation algorithm.
