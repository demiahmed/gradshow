    <title-text title="The Waste Euphoria"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Waste: unwanted matter or material of any type, especially what is left after useful substances or parts have been removed.
    <br><br>  
    This project aims to change the problematic concept of waste as an externality and to redefine the concept of “waste”.  Introducing Waste as an asset that could enable and empower marginalized communities while reversing the years of pollution suffered by these communities through the use of micro-algae. Waste is a social, spatial, and economic externality that is regarded by the cities and municipalities as a liability that needs to be dealt with.  Through chutes, bins, trucks, all the way to the sites designed to hide waste: mines, landfills, ghost towns, the ocean floor, and even the earth’s orbit. The NIMBY mindset has led many developed countries like the US, Canada, Australia, UK, and Europe have diverted their issues of waste to developing countries to deal with. 
     <br><br>
    The project creates a new narrative for the marginalized poor that has been left behind in the old sinking capital as the rich moves to the newly build capital in the neighboring island. Harnessing the waste that has been left behind in the old capital to rebuild a new future. Where waste is processed and recycled to form new building blocks for the community. At the same time using algae to as a mediator to resolve the issue of water scarcity within the capital."

    title="Site Analysis" 
    text="After analysis of the possible sites in Jakarta, Cilincing, Jakarta was chosen as its one of Jakarta’s poorest neighborhood located in the north of Jakarta. 
    <br><br>
    Research has shown that by 2015 Cilincing had already sunk by 1.5 meters. It is also predicted that by 2050, more than 90% of North Jakarta home to more than 1.6 million residents will be under water. The rapidly sinking area as well as it close to one of the main landfills that serves the north of Jakarta has made it the perfect site to be a test bed for the project."

    title="Algae infrastructure" 
    text="The algae infrastructure acts as a bridge between the productive systems and the living quarters. Different algae cultivation systems are deployed to cater to the specific needs within the ecosystem. <br><br>
    The algae infrastructure consists of 3 fundamental systems. One, the algae runway ponds. Two, the algae closed loop system. Three, algae processing system. <br><br>
    The runway ponds serve as a base cultivation where sea water is desalinated to produce clean water for use within the productive system. <br><br>
    The close loop algae system is designed based on the volumetric needs of each living clusters. Where all the loops are connected back into the main algae system. Each loop caters to one living cluster where greywater collected will be processed by the micro-algae before it is reintroduced." ></image-text>

    title="Commons" 
    text="The commons are made up of 5 programs: The marketplace forming the base of the commons. The learning labs where the residents learn more about the different recycling processes and the algae infrastructure. Childcares, clinics, and entertainment centres make up the remaining 3 programs.
    <br><br> With the marketplace at the base, the commons are agglomerated catering to the growing need of the community. <br><br>
    The commons also serve as a bridge between the productive spine and the housing modules."

    title="Aquaculture" 
    text="Within the enclave of the housing infrastructure, aquaculture is practiced. Through the analysis of diverse aquaculture systems, seaweed and mussels cultivation are chosen due to their suitability in shallow seawater. The aquaculture modules allow for the community to cultivate their own food, allowing them to be self-sustainable."
