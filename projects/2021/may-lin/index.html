    title="Site Anaylsis" 
    text="After analysis of the possible sites in Jakarta, Cilincing, Jakarta was chosen as its one of Jakarta’s poorest neighborhood located in the north of Jakarta. 
    <br><br>
    Research has shown that by 2015 Cilincing had already sunk by 1.5 meters. It is also predicted that by 2050, more than 90% of North Jakarta home to more than 1.6 million residents will be under water. The rapidly sinking area as well as it close to one of the main landfills that serves the north of Jakarta has made it the perfect site to be a test bed for the project."
