    main-title="Summary"
    summary="At a time when human disturbance to the environment is challenging  liveability on the planet - for humans and nonhumans alike - it is  important to find better construction methods that not only engages  with the liveliness of the movement of people in and out of developing  cities, but also minimises the ecological impact on the region due to  the amount of buildings that would be created or destroyed.

    <br><br>  
    This thesis investigates the viability of implementing digitally  fabricated architecture as a solution to the urban sprawl within rapidly  growing refugee camps, focusing on local materials that can
feed into the development of a circular economic model for building  constructions within the city.

    aboutme="As a designer, I am particularly interested in parametric design for architecture and excited at oppurtunities to utilise computation as a tool to improve the architectural design process.
     <br><br>          
     I am also very interested in rethinking how we can fuse the traditional with advanced technologies."

    title="Digital Tools for Architecture" 
    text="The proliferation of digital tools  have provided designers with unprecedented flexibility. These tools have brought about a new mode of designing architecture, where architectural form can be expressed as generative rules so that transformation can be accelerated and iterated.
	<br><br> 
	During the last 35 years, digitally-driven design has become commonplace within the realm of academic research as a tool for creating models and full scale working prototypes and,in very rare instances,
it is used as a method of manufacture by specialists to fabricate custom components for buildings.

    title="Earth as a material"
    text="Earth is a construction material  that behaves optimally in situations  where there is purely compressive  forces. Research has been conducted  comparatively to evaluate the  compressive and tensile forces that
earth is able to withstand. Generally,  it has been observed that for a  similar section of earth, the tensile  strength is only a meagre 8~10% of  the compressive strength.

    title="The Digital Vernacular" 
    text="While digital design  methods have had  apparent influence in  the limitless possibilities  to generate complex  forms, where the Digital  Vernacular is involved,  the presence of the word  “vernacular” applies to  aspects of architecture  that are not relatable
by digital tools, but the  conditions of a specific  place and time that  would influence design  and construction.
<br><br> 
The Digital Vernacular  will be guided by a set of principles, having  their origin in vernacular culture and design  with an ethic of sustainability, further enhanced  with an involvement of the digital tools that  provide greater awareness, speed and capacity  relative to construction. Through iterating
and improving, the digital vernacular follows  a design approach that is not alien to both
vernacular and digital design.

    title="Unlocking the Dome"
    text="The potential of  involving digital design  in architecture is the  liberation from simpler  geometries, giving  designers flexibility
in geometry to create  purposeful design on a  multitude of scales in a  building.
<br><br>
Where the vernacular  is a powerful ethic that  leverages the power of  community knowledge  to continually develop,  refine and innovate,  usage of digital tools  can further push
this notion, through  parameterization and  iteration.
<br><br>
From the previous dome studies, we can use digital design to liberate the ancient earthen dome from it’s arched form. There is a potential to re-design the dome on various scales, firstly on the skin, followed by a single unit, then the creation of aggregated domes. Finally, on a settlement wide scale, there is the potential to design for clusters or in other words, the population of the settlement.

    text="A few of these operations have been looked at in more detail, where abstracted parametric models were built to evaluate how these operations could be broken down into simpler rules to create variant forms. Lessons were then extracted from these studies to generate first ideas onto how they could be applied to the final design of a new dome-like typology."

    title="Kakuma - The Transitional City"
    text="The proposed site is Kakuma refugee camp. It can be defined as an overflowing city where there are many new refugee arrivals year on year. It is also seen as a “permanent” location for many of these refugees, as they spend an average of 17 years inside the camp. There are many informal markets that fuel the local economy as well, making it seem like a city within a camp."

    title="Site Analysis" 
    text="The spatial impact due to the influx of refugees have been prominent throughout the years since it’s establishment. 
	Starting out as just a singular camp near Kakuma town, the refugee camp has been growing so much that it has expanded into 4 separate camps, and another one being established in recent years in the nearby Kalobeyei town
<br><br> 
The potential of Kakuma as a site for a proposal has been evaluated. A closer look into how the city functions can help inform planning strategies. 
Ideally, looking at specific site and urban conditions, the proposal of a 3D printed city would help alleviate some existing problems faced by the camp.

    title="Site Design"
    text="The implementation of the civilization happens in 3 phases. This would take place over a few months, where government and local administration would work in tandem with refugees to set up their new areas of residence.
		<br><br> <b>Phase 1 - Setting up infrastructure</b> <br><br> <i>Firstly, by overlaying a hexagonal grid derived from the proportions of the WASP crane, it serves as a basis for the placement of infrastructural modules. Plots of land are selected based on the space usage for the people/families that will be inhabiting the site. 
This helps inform various public facilities that could be provided on site. The construction of the Infrastructure modules on the site marks the end of the intervention from the Government and authoritarian bodies and provides a well-equipped canvas for the user to drive the architecture based on comfort, preferences and economic situations.</i>


		<br><br> <b>Phase 2 - Material excavation + Home printing</b>  <br><br> <i>Residents participate in the construction process, excavating earth to procure material to 3D print their homes. The skilled workers assist with the printing of houses, transferring technical knowledge to local residents as well</i>
 

		<br><br> <b>Phase 3 - Reinvigorating outdoors</b>  <br><br> <i>Outdoor spaces start to get recognised by local residents, and are used to bring out their preferences and values to the urban environment. Making use of the leftover space, the system permits a distribution of programmes. Primary courtyards for huge gatherings are connected to courtyards that are more communal and private to “localised” clusters. </i>

These could feed into communal dining, playgrounds, as well as semi private courtyards that open up into possibly kitchens and the living spaces of the refugees as well.
