    main-title="Summary"
    summary="At a time when human disturbance to the environment is challenging  liveability on the planet - for humans and nonhumans alike - it is  important to find better construction methods that not only engages  with the liveliness of the movement of people in and out of developing  cities, but also minimises the ecological impact on the region due to  the amount of buildings that would be created or destroyed.

    <br><br>  
    This thesis investigates the viability of implementing digitally  fabricated architecture as a solution to the urban sprawl within rapidly  growing refugee camps, focusing on local materials that can
feed into the development of a circular economic model for building  constructions within the city.

    title="Earth as a material"
    text="Earth is a construction material  that behaves optimally in situations  where there is purely compressive  forces. Research has been conducted  comparatively to evaluate the  compressive and tensile forces that
earth is able to withstand. Generally,  it has been observed that for a  similar section of earth, the tensile  strength is only a meagre 8~10% of  the compressive strength.

    title="Digitally Enhanced Construction" 
    text="While digital design  methods have had  apparent influence in  the limitless possibilities  to generate complex  forms, where the a vernacular material like earth is involved, 
the  conditions of a specific  place and time would have great influence on design  and construction.
<br><br> 
An interest in digital fabrication was the strongest driving force of this thesis, and thus and investigation was made into how highly technological tools can go hand in hand with a very basic building material like wet earth. The 4 main processes
of digital fabrication were looked into detail and specifically their applications with earth to determine which process would be ideal for creating earthen constructions with digital methods.

    title="The WASP Crane"
    text="Taking upon an expansive approach to creating new earthen huts, the WASP crane was chosen. The network of crane arms on modular space frame structures allow clusters of geometry to be printed at the same time.

<br><br>
The WASP crane enables collaboration between skilled labour and a technical workforce. It is light, affordable and easy to operate after a few months of training. The local labour receives new skills in 3D printing construction, while allowing for community participation and skills transfer in the realization of the project.

    title="Unlocking the Dome"
    text="The potential of  involving digital design  in architecture is the  liberation from simpler  geometries, giving  designers flexibility
in geometry to create  purposeful design on a  multitude of scales in a  building.
<br><br>
Where the vernacular  is a powerful ethic that  leverages the power of  community knowledge  to continually develop,  refine and innovate,  usage of digital tools  can further push
this notion, through  parameterization and  iteration.
<br><br>
From the previous dome studies, we can use digital design to liberate the ancient earthen dome from it’s arched form. There is a potential to re-design the dome on various scales, firstly on the skin, followed by a single unit, then the creation of aggregated domes. Finally, on a settlement wide scale, there is the potential to design for clusters or in other words, the population of the settlement.

    text="A few of these operations have been looked at in more detail, where abstracted parametric models were built to evaluate how these operations could be broken down into simpler rules to create variant forms. Lessons were then extracted from these studies to generate first ideas onto how they could be applied to the final design of a new dome-like typology."

    title="Combining Operations"
    text="From the previous studies on ancient earthen forms and the functions they provide, these operations have been combined to give rise to a singular 3D printable form. 
<br><br>

The designed geometry would be populated throughout the printed huts, creating a new earthen skin that has various functions, such as providing ventilation, directing water flow as well as creating lighting conditions on the exterior environment.
<br><br>
The resulting earthen hut as combination of multiple domes gives rise to interior and exterior spaces that can be moulded to the preferences of each user. For instance, the dome can be covered up with soil on one end for greater privacy, while gentle sloping on the other to give opportunities for localised farming activities.

    text="The proposed site is Kakuma refugee camp. It can be defined as an overflowing city where there are many new refugee arrivals year on year. It is also seen as a “permanent” location for many of these refugees, as they spend an average of 17 years inside the camp. There are many informal markets that fuel the local economy as well, making it seem like a city within a camp."

    title="Site Analysis" 
    text="The spatial impact due to the influx of refugees have been prominent throughout the years since it’s establishment. 
	Starting out as just a singular camp near Kakuma town, the refugee camp has been growing so much that it has expanded into 4 separate camps, and another one being established in recent years in the nearby Kalobeyei town
<br><br> 
The potential of Kakuma as a site for a proposal has been evaluated. A closer look into how the city functions can help inform planning strategies. 
Ideally, looking at specific site and urban conditions, the proposal of a 3D printed city would help alleviate some existing problems faced by the camp.

    title="Site Design"
    text="The implementation of the civilization happens in 3 phases. This would take place over a few months, where government and local administration would work in tandem with refugees to set up their new areas of residence.
		<br><br> <b>Phase 1 - Setting up infrastructure</b> <br><br> <i>Firstly, by overlaying a hexagonal grid derived from the proportions of the WASP crane, it serves as a basis for the placement of infrastructural modules. Plots of land are selected based on the space usage for the people/families that will be inhabiting the site. 
This helps inform various public facilities that could be provided on site. The construction of the Infrastructure modules on the site marks the end of the intervention from the Government and authoritarian bodies and provides a well-equipped canvas for the user to drive the architecture based on comfort, preferences and economic situations.</i>


		<br><br> <b>Phase 2 - Material excavation + Home printing</b>  <br><br> <i>Residents participate in the construction process, excavating earth to procure material to 3D print their homes. The skilled workers assist with the printing of houses, transferring technical knowledge to local residents as well</i>
 

		<br><br> <b>Phase 3 - Reinvigorating outdoors</b>  <br><br> <i>Outdoor spaces start to get recognised by local residents, and are used to bring out their preferences and values to the urban environment. Making use of the leftover space, the system permits a distribution of programmes. Primary courtyards for huge gatherings are connected to courtyards that are more communal and private to “localised” clusters. </i>

These could feed into communal dining, playgrounds, as well as semi private courtyards that open up into possibly kitchens and the living spaces of the refugees as well.
