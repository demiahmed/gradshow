    main-title="Summary"
    summary="In 2019, the COVID-19, an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease, has led to a majority of
	global borders being shut as a means to halt the spread of the virus. This has led to airports being
	shuttered and decimating economies in the process. The airport is an important infrastructure to
	the development and economic growth of cities, countries, and regions but the pandemic outbreak
	has hit airports hard, which has severely impacted the movement of goods and people.
    <br><br>  
    This thesis is set to explore Singapore as a site and investigate the feasibility of integrating a spaceport and the re-adaptability of runways as a sustainable approach for horizontal take-offs of spacecraft, to become the foundation for a global suborbital transportation network."

    title="Introduction"
    text="In today’s world, regardless of air, road, and water mobility, the efficiency, speed, interconnectivity,
	and accessibility of the mode of transportation is essential. These modes of transportation are the
	forefront of our socio-economic fabric as they promote social connections and facilitate access to
	goods and services globally.
	<br><br>
	Over the past century, the aviation industry has started from learning to fly, to learning to fly faster,
	further, and now to have over 100,000 commercial flight traffic around the world each day. Indeed,
	aviation has been at the front of innovation, becoming one of the safest and most reliable modes
	of transportation in modern world history.
	<br><br> 
	During 2018, global passenger traffic grew 6.4 per cent to a total of 8.8 billion passengers. Despite short term challenges like the global economic slowdown, passenger numbers are expected to power through and over the long term, passenger traffic worldwide is expected to more than double."

	"In 2020, the world was ravaged by a global pandemic, which has presented multiple challenges to the aviation industry. 
	It was one of the hardest hit industries as countries scramble to halt the spread of COVID through border closures, 
	which has led to global travels coming to a standstill and a drastic fall in passenger traffic.
	<br><br>
	However, in the post pandemic state, it is expected that passenger traffic will gradually bounce back through short term measures 
	like a travel bubble, travel corridor agreements or vaccinated travel lanes and other universal protocols for safe travel that are agreed upon by governments. 
	Eventually, air passenger traffic worldwide is expected to reach higher heights as it did through the different crisis it has faced in the past 
	like the Iran-Iraq war or SARS.
	<br><br>
	Looking ahead, it is important for the industry to rejuvenate and reinvent itself; firstly, to recover to the pre-pandemic traveling state and secondly, 
	to ensure the aviation industry becomes better prepared to cope with similar challenges in the future. 
	This can be done through support investment in sustainability which should address the whole aviation value chain, 
	and through the innovative exploration of futuristic transportation like sending paying customers to the space station and more."

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; There is an emerging industry thought to be only science fiction not too long ago, that is fast becoming
		a reality: Space Tourism. The main supporting infrastructure for space tourism is a spaceport and
		the spaceport or cosmodrome is defined to be a &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; site for launching or receiving spacecraft. The cosmodrome has historically been used for sites capable of launching spacecraft 
		into orbit around
		Earth or on interplanetary trajectories. However, launch sites for purely sub-orbital flights are increasingly
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; coined as spaceports.
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The future of Aviation is the Spaceport. As the world embraces this new frontier of travel, design
		solutions will be required to ensure it will not be at the expense of the environment. The re-adaptability
		of airports or aerodromes to support and integrate &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; spaceports will be essential as it is not only
		a sustainable approach to revolutionise travel, but it will also ensure that the built landscape will
		be rooted in the tenet of ambition and continuation. The spaceport has the potential to give the world a whole &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

    image="./data/Infographics I_Comparison of Spaceflight Paths.png"
    title="Types of Spaceflight"
    text=
	"Spaceflight is an application of aeronautics to fly the spacecraft into or through outer space, either
	with or without humans on board. Examples of human spaceflight include the U.S. Apollo Moon
	Landing and Space Shuttle programs and the Russian Soyuz program, not forgetting the ongoing
	International Space Station. On the other hand, examples of unmanned spaceflight include space
	probes that leave Earth orbit as well as satellites that orbit around Earth.
	<br><br>
	There are two main types of spaceflights which are the orbital and suborbital spaceflights. The main
	difference between orbital and suborbital flight is the speed at which the vehicle is travelling. An
	orbital spacecraft must achieve orbital velocity which is 28,000 km/h whereas a suborbital flight
	requires much lower speeds. A suborbital rocket does not have the power to achieve orbit. Instead,
	it will soar up to a specific height that depends on its speed, and then come back down once its
	engines are shut off. To reach 200 km above Earth, a spacecraft is required to fly at a relatively
	lower speed of 6,000 km/h, even though that is still six times faster than a commercial airplane,
	which flies at around 925 km/h.
	<br><br>
	At the height of their flight trajectory, passengers in a suborbital vehicle will still be able to achieve
	a few minutes of weightlessness. No matter, how far into space a spaceflight goes, if the trajectory
	falls back to earth, it is still termed as a suborbital flight. In general, suborbital spaceflight takes far
	less energy and as a result much less expensive in comparison with orbital spaceflight, and it is one
	of the main reasons, several companies are competing to be leaders in the emerging market. The
	major difference in the destinations of the human spaceflight offerings in development will result
	in notable distinctions in the cost, experience, and even risk of what it means to be a space tourist.
	<br><br>
	Considering the advancements made in the realm of suborbital space tourism, it is safe to assume
	that private paying passengers can be sent on suborbital spaceflight within the next thirty years."

    title="Types of Spacecrafts"
    text=
	"A spacecraft is a machine designed to fly in the cosmos. It is a category of artificial satellite that are
	used for a range of purposes which includes communications, Earth observation, meteorology,
	navigation and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft aside from single-stage-to-orbit
	vehicles cannot be launched into space on their own and require a launch vehicle or a carrier rocket.
	<br><br>
	For orbital space travel, the spacecraft enters closed orbits around the Earth or around other
	planets. On the other hand, a sub-orbital spaceflight, is where a space vehicle enters space and
	returns to the surface subsequently, without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make
	a full orbit of the Earth.
	<br><br>
	The spacecraft can be broadly categorised into Vertical Take-off-Vertical Landing (VTVL) and
	Horizontal Take-off-Horizontal-Landing (HTHL) vehicles."
   	 ></image-text>

    <special-image url="./data/Infographics I_Timeline.png"></special-image>
	<p> 
	&emsp;&emsp; Despite the Covid-19 crisis, the race to the commercial viability of spaceflights has increased over the last few years.
	In particular, the last few months saw Richard branson, the founder of virgin galactic and Jeff bezos, the founder of blue origin and amazon 
	successfully flew to
	<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; space in the spacecrafts developed by their respective companies. 
	<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp; This will no doubt assure the general public and potential paying passengers of the reliability of spaceflights.

	"COMPARISON OF CARBON EMISSIONS BETWEEN ROCKET FLIGHT AND AIR FLIGHT
	<br><br><br>
	While the effects of climate change become more apparent, with increasing floods and wildfires spreading uncontrollably throughout Europe during the fall of 2021, 
	the world becomes increasingly aware of the harmful impact that carbon emissions have on our environment and their catalytic role in accelerating climate change. 
	<br><br>
	Even though the carbon emissions per passenger, per mile for rocket flight is ten times more than either a short haul or long haul flight, 
	it should be noted that spaceflight remains in its infancy phase, thus it is unlikely that rocket flights will become a regular occurrence in the next ten years. 
	Consequently, the carbon emission footprint of spaceflight will remain modest. However, it is expected that carbon emissions will be greatly reduced in years to 
	come due to the technological advancements in materials and fuels. 
	<br><br>
	This will allow space tourism to take off and spaceflight companies can sustainably conduct airline-like operations."

		<br><br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The aviation industry in Singapore is one of the most 
		integral components of the Singapore economy, and it is regarded as a major aviation hub in Southeast Asia, with Changi Airport consistently 
		ranked as the sixth busiest
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  airport in SEA. Additionally, Singapore’s location along the equator not only allows the spacecraft to carry 
		lesser fuels to reach their desired location but also cost savings for commercial space operators. 
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Finally, the island already boasts one of the premier seaports in the world, and the addition of a spaceport can propel 
		Singapore as a major transportation hub for the sea, air, and space.

    title="Site Study & Analysis" 
    text="The global airspace is divided into Flight Information Regions (FIRs) that is agreed upon by countries in 1944 during the “Chicago Convention” 
	which is also known as the Convention on International Civil Aviation. An FIR by definition refers to the airspace of specific margins within which there 
	has to be a provision of flight information service and alerting service. 
	<br><br>
	The provision of this essential information and services is coordinated and governed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), 
	a specialised agency under the United Nations (UN) which is founded for this purpose. This ongoing worldwide system of FIRs has been in effect for several decades.
	<br><br>
	Even as a country with a vast sovereign territory may operate more than one FIR, a small country like Singapore can also control 
	an FIR that is larger than its own sovereign airspace, which even encompasses the borders of its neighbours. 
	In reality, the Singapore FIR is estimated to be a thousand times larger than the size of Singapore itself, 
	approximately 800,000 square kilometres. The current Singapore FIR not only includes its national airspace but also part of the airspace over
	the coastal regions of Indonesia and the South China Sea. In addition, Singapore manages the traffic of airspace which comprises 
	the Natuna islands, Tanjung Pinang, and the Riau Archipelago as part of the Singapore FIR.
	<br><br>
	With Singapore part of three of the world’s busiest international air routes coupled with the increasing number of flights in the region, 
	there is a pressing need for capable and reliable air traffic management capabilities. This is especially true as the thesis studies Singapore 
	as a site for a spaceport."

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In Singapore, there are 4 main airbase and an airport. 
		On a micro scale, the airspace is segregated to no-fly zones which are restricted airspace to prevent aerial objects flown near aircrafts, 
		which can endanger the lives of those on
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; board and on the ground. Thus, these no-fly zones usually exists right above the airbase or airport and 
		no aerial activities can be conducted in the vicinity without a permit.
 		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The study of the flight paths reveals that in general, 
		military aircrafts land from the south to avoid airspace infringement in the neighbouring airspace. 
		Due to the proximity of paya lebar airbase to changi airport, aircrafts cannot turn

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; These are the 5 main factors to select a site for a spaceport. The site must first support a runway that is at least or capable of 
		extending to 3000m and a segregated airspace for spaceflights with the main priority of 
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; protecting the uninvolved public.
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The site is preferably located away from urban areas while relevant health and safety legislation should be in place such

		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Strong crosswinds on site could impede spaceflight operatives and commercial implications may result from poor weather, 
		such as the experience of spaceflight not living up to the expectation of the passenger.
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In the short-term, aviation environmental regulations would apply to spaceplane operations while environmental issues and storage 
		of hazardous materials like fuels need to be considered as well.
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Lastly, the site must have good surface access to link space tourists to the spaceport. 
		<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; One can imagine that in the near future, spaceports becoming centers of great economic activity,

	"The safe operating capacity of airspace is limited by factors such as safety and efficiency. With an
	ever congested airspace in Singapore, it is important to organise the urban airspace in order to
	make full use of the entirety of the airspace such that both air flight and spaceflight can occur in
	the same volume of space without risking the lives and safety of passengers and crew members
	on-board the aircraft and space vehicle.
	<br><br>
	Airspace management looks at de-conflicting all the operations of air traffic through a structured
	airspace concept design. There are four airspace concepts namely, the full-mix, layered,
	zones, and the tubes concepts.
	<br><br>
	The safe operating capacity of airspace is limited by factors such as safety and efficiency.
	With an increasingly dynamic and ever-evolving airspace in Singapore, a hybrid concept can be adopted
	for efficient and collision-free air traffic management. The successful implementation of the airspace
	architecture can allow HTHL, VTVL space vehicles and aircrafts to co-exist and flown in the same
	volume of airspace environment over densely populated urban spaces."

	"In the dynamic and ever-evolving airspace in Singapore, a hybrid concept can be adopted for 
	efficient and collision-free air traffic management. The successful implementation of the airspace architecture can allow HTHL, 
	VTVL space vehicles and aircrafts to co-exist and flown in the same volume of airspace environment over densely populated urban spaces.
	<br><br>
	In the proposed hybrid airspace architecture (Fig 24), the sovereign airspace of Singapore is seen as a volume of space that is divided 
	into several horizontal volumetric segments. Within each layer of airspace lies tube structures, which comprise airways and nodes. 
	Airways in this case are defined to be corridors connecting nodes within a horizontal layer or between layers that can either be vertical or diagonal.
	<br><br>
	If the airspace architecture is in operation, flight paths of aircraft and spacecraft could be separated by altitude segments or layers, 
	where lower altitude layers will be reserved for aircraft while higher altitude layers will be given priority to spacecraft. 
	Each altitude layer will allow different velocity ranges that increase at higher altitude layers, which is optimal for spacecraft to offer a 
	shorter travel time to reach apogee, where space tourists can experience weightlessness.
	<br><br>
	In order to transit between altitude layers, aircraft can enter airways through different nodes to reach the intended destinations.
	<br><br>
	Such an airspace architecture model allows pilots of aircraft and spacecraft to make local routing decisions to switch between tubular paths 
	and altitude layers with respect to their intended flight objectives. Not only can a hybrid airspace model minimise the time of flight or 
	energy consumption, but it can also allow multi-modal air transport, aircraft, and spacecraft to be flown safely and minimising the risk of 
	collision above densely populated areas of Singapore."

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Due to the strategic location of Singapore,

    text="Singapore’s road network which comprises expressways and roads connects all corners of the island. 
	The reliability and connectivity of the road network can not only serve growing communities but also 
	allow space tourists to travel by car or bus to complete their journey to the space launch complex.
	<br><br>
	The local rail transport network spans the entire city and is set to be expanded further by the 2030s, 
	allowing eight in ten households to be within a ten-minute walking distance to a train station. 
	The proposal for a spaceport can take advantage of the existing transport infrastructure inland to the space launch complex.
	<br><br>
	Singapore also has ferry terminals along its coasts to link the main island to its neighbouring islands like Pulau Ubin 
	and connecting to neighbouring countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Aside from providing space tourists from neighbouring 
	countries an alternate route from air travel, to end their travel at the aerodrome for their spaceflight, 
	they can allow space tourists to have a short getaway to nearby islands and marine parks that are off the coast of Singapore, 
	upon disembarking from their spaceflight.
	<br><br>
	By evaluating the available aerodrome sites in Singapore, Sudong island represents an attractive site to integrate a spaceport into 
	its infrastructure. Even though it may lack surface access and rail transport network to supplement the accessibility to the site, 
	it offers not only largely uncongested airspace which is essential for operating space vehicles but also a largely unpopulated land, 
	which are critical factors to allow spaceflight to be conducted with minimal risk of collision with aircraft and its area of impact 
	on the uninvolved population is significantly lower compared to if a spaceflight were to be conducted on the mainland.
	<br><br>
	As affluent space tourists are expected to be the main category of paying customers should commercial spaceflight take fruition, having 
	these tourists travel to the space complex via a ferry from the mainland could add a layer of novelty for them.
	When space tourism becomes mainstream, adjacent islands Pulau Senang and Pulau Pawai can be expanded into and 
	supplement the space tourism operatives off Sudong island."
