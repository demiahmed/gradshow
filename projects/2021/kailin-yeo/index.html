    main-title="Summary"
    summary="<i>‘Homo Ludens (Man at play) himself will seek to transform, to recreate, those surroundings, that world, according to his new needs’ </i> -- Constant, New Babylon 
    <br><br>  
    28 years ago, the World Wide Web made its debut into the mainstream, following the Information Age that accelerated the Digital Revolution. Its impact was profound, forever changing the way we navigate the world and exchange. In congested cities where public spaces are scarce, who determines how a space should be used? After all, people have different needs and different desires. As societies develop and enter the Digital Age, it's time to perceive public spaces beyond the analog impression of the static brick and mortar. 
	<br><br>
	Thus, <b> this thesis aims to create a new personalised commons in contested public spaces, in the form of a mixed reality Internet-of-Things (IOT) embedded environment </b>."

    aboutme="Hi! I'm Kai Lin, a Master of Architecture graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design. With the pandemic forcing many to work and live through the online realm, it made me wonder – Should our online and physical worlds merge into one, how would that affect the way we navigate our environment?

    title="Design Framework" 
    text="Conceptually, the thesis is based on the idea of a digital ecology where there are different users, and all tied together with the digital artifacts that surround them. Using AR and IoT, the ability to fluidly manipulate perceptive and actual changes is imagined and witnessed through three time scales of the Immediate, Delayed, and Accumulated. This is explored through two platforms of the Individual Digital Augmentation and Physical Embedded Environment.

    title="Design Proposal"
    text="The design proposal illustrates three fronts, starting with how smart wearables can be used to augment our spatial perception. Next, it proposes sensors and smart devices to be embedded in the existing buildings and infrastructure to calibrate things like lighting and air conditioning to the people within. Finally, it proposes a method of virtual feedback sourcing for the construction of a renewed shophouse building."

    title="Testbed Site" 
    text="Hoan Kiếm, Hanoi, Vietnam, is chosen as a representative testbed site. It has a high population density accounted in residential, commerce, and tourism sectors. Notably, the Hoan Kiếm district features low-rise spontaneous buildings and a generally cramped public space.
	<br><br>
	From here on, we will look through the perspectives of four user groups: Children, Tourists. Street Vendors, and Youth. Each character represents a different usage of the same public street scape, which can be conflicting sometimes.
