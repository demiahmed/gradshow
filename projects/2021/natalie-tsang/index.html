    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis explores a prototypical architecture practice that uses rammed earth architecture to advocate sustainable living. The overarching aim is to develop an earth-loving community, while the underlying objective is to develop a concept and model that enables contemporary construction yet promotes sustainable living.
    <br><br>  
    In other words, the concept aims to go beyond achieving greater energy efficiency or a reduction in emissions. It seeks to lead and support the transformation towards socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative communities.
    <br><br>
    This thesis's prototype is a soil research centre that doubles off as a coliving community for the researchers, nature lovers, and their families. This new sustainable concept will lubricate the path towards the notion of co-living with nature. Following this, this research centre can be further used as an example to develop and promote other forms of coliving that coexist with nature."

    <br><br>          
    My interests lies in humanistic and social architecture that places people's wellbeing as the core building design, using people-centric design. Thus, my project aims to create solutions for problems and opportunities by focusing on the needs and emotions of the people."

    title="About Pulau Ubin" 
    text="For this prototype, I’ve chosen Pulau  Ubin as my stie. Pulau Ubin is a small island northeast of mainland Singapore. Pulau ubin known for its rich soil and biodiversity. its site’s natural environment helps with the goal of my earth architecture thesis. Infact, Ubin is  being proposed as an ecological living lab. Nparks have been very supportive of researchers in Pulau Ubin, and there has even been a call for further lab development."

    title="The Site"
    text="It is critical to choose a specific site in Ubin that does not require removing the existing trees and affecting the wildlife as little as possible. Moreover, it is also important for the site to be abundant in soil since the thesis is about earth architecture
    <br><br>
    Hence, this site is chosen based on:
    <br><br>
    1. Accessibility
    <br><br>
    2. Amount of bare land
    <br><br>
    3. Soil Fertility
    <br><br>
    4. Distance from Quarry
    <br><br>
    The site area is about 14500sqm, making it suitable for small scale co-living / coworking facilities."

    title="Design Strategy 1" 
    text=" The first design goal is to bring people together with nature by using the site’s earth as a resource for food and housing. The idea is to use different composition of rocks and earth found from pulau ubin, to build colourful rammed earth walls to use in this project.
    <br><br>
    As for target users, we have the researchers, nature lovers who are able to conduct workshops and help out tis ecosystem, the families of the researchers and nature lovers – which includes the elderly and children.
    <br><br>
   The programs are centred around the concept of grounded living, as earth as the vessel in forming this community. In which, it consist of research, farming, food, and engagement. For research, there is a need for research labs that does soil testing and co creation rooms where people come together to brainstorm and innovate. Research is important to get good soil since Singapore lacks good soil and soil is essential for farming and food. A very crucial role in the community is farming. It is important to be sustainable in terms of food and thus we have this farm to table concept, where the community grows their own food. Last but not least, we have engagement. Engagement is important in sharing knowledge to the public and essential in learning. There are activities that relates to the site and earth, such as pottery and horticulture classes led by the people in the community themselves. Everyone in this community plays an essential role. Even the elderly and young are able to learn and grow together through these activities. The nature playground encourages the young ones to grow, learn, and play with nature."

    title="Design Strategy 2" 
    text="Design strategy 2 is stacking of rammed earth to form massing and programming. As you can see from the massing, the blocks are centred around the central courtyard and they form void spaces between them that allows for social spaces. The massing represents how the different programs can come together to form a community."

    title="Design Strategy 4" 
    text="Design Strategy 4 is ensuring a ground up collaborative community spirit, by involving the residents in making the architecture itself and making sure spaces promote collaborative spirit.
    <br><br>
    Taking inspiration from the hakka tulous, the residential layout follows a public to private division of spaces. As one enters into this co-housing unit, one walks into the shared common space. Then, he enters into a shared private space that can be used as a hobby room or interest room that is shared between another person. The last layer would be his individual bedroom where he gets his privacy. A couple can also choose to take down the walls to form a bigger room.
    <br><br>
    Moving on to the construction, we encourage the people to take part in building their own home. To do so, they are able to build prefab units of the walls. Each individual prefab wall will span 1.8m in length in order for easy transportation, and is sandwhiched between concrete slabs with prefab concrete beams with joints that are cast insitu."

    title="Design Strategy 5" 
    text="In conditions with a high moisture content, it is possible to see signs of biological colonization. This results in the growth of plants and colonization of animals and insects within the structure. However, instead of seeing this as a weakness, I want to leave some areas susceptible to weathering and biodiversity to be “part of” the architecture. Other areas of living can include silicate-based waterproofing agent to avoid this.

   Lastly, height below canopy level, to minimize disturbance of wildlife and it also promotes coliving with nature."
