    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis explores a prototypical architecture practice that uses rammed earth architecture to advocate sustainable living.The overarching aim is to develop an earth-loving community, while the underlying objective is to develop a concept and model that enables contemporary construction yet promotes sustainable living.
    <br><br>  
    This thesis's prototype is a soil research centre that doubles off as a coliving community for the researchers, nature lovers, and their families. This new sustainable concept will lubricate the path towards the notion of co-living with nature. Following this, this research centre can be further used as an example to develop and promote other forms of coliving that coexist w nature."

    <br><br>          
    My interests lies in humanistic and social architecture that places people's wellbeing as the core building design, using people-centric design. Thus, my project aims to create solutions for problems and opportunities by focusing on the needs and emotions of the people."

    title="About Pulau Ubin" 
    text="For this prototype, I’ve chosen Pulau  Ubin as my stie. Pulau Ubin is a small island northeast of mainland Singapore. Pulau ubin known for its rich soil and biodiversity. its site’s natural environment helps with the goal of my earth architecture thesis. Infact, Ubin is  being proposed as an ecological living lab. Nparks have been very supportive of researchers in Pulau Ubin, and there has even been a call for further lab development."

    title="The Site"
    text="It is critical to choose a specific site in Ubin that does not require removing the existing trees and affecting the wildlife as little as possible. Moreover, it is also important for the site to be abundant in soil since the thesis is about earth architecture
    <br><br>
    Hence, this site is chosen based on:
    <br><br>
    1. Accessibility
    <br><br>
    2. Amount of bare land
    <br><br>
    3. Soil Fertility
    <br><br>
    4. Distance from Quarry
    <br><br>
    The site area is about 14500sqm, making it suitable for small scale co-living / coworking facilities."

    title="Design Strategies" 
    text=" 1. Bringing people together with nature by using rammed earth as a construction mateiral
    <br><br>
    2. Prefab rammed earth stacking strategy – to allow easy modification/changes/additions 
    <br><br>
    3. Leaving certain areas susceptible to weathering and biodiversity to be “part of” the architecture
    <br><br>
    4. Height below canopy level – minimize disturbance of wildlife"

    title="Target Users & Programs" 
    text="Prefabricated rammed earth walls are used in the construction. Each individual prefab wall will span 6m in length and is sandwiched between concrete slabs with prefab concrete beams with joints that are cast in-situ. The individual prefab walls will be then join together by concrete footings and cement in between
    <br><br>
    Programs are then decided base on the users and target goals, and the quantity of each unit and space required is calculated. For residential, there are co-living units for individuals and short term stay, and family units. We have our research labs with different sizes. Green spaces and activity areas that includes the outdoor plaza, and workshops that hosts earth related programs such as pottery, horticulture classes that teaches home gardening for example. And others, f&bs, fitness, elderly activity centre and kindergarten, which includes indoor and outdoor spaces, to encourage outdoor learning."
