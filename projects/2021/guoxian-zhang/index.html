    <title-text title="HYPER VILLAGE: PIXEL COMMUNITIES"></title-text>

    <project-bio main-title="SYSTEM FOR JAPAN'S RURAL DEVELOPMENT"
                 summary="HYPER VILLAGE: The next step in urban development first proposed by Arita Isozaki that describes the post metropolitan era in the near future. The act of urbanization has historically been carried out in Tokyo city and the Greater Tokyo area ever since the 1970s, as The Tokaido Megapolis Masterplan by Tange and air travel networks designed by Shimokobe connected Tokyo City and developed the Tokyo region into the megapolis we see today. Due to the increase in population in cities from rural-urban migration and metropolitan fever, urban planners and architects have always placed emphasis on the development and intensification of cities. As a result, the ageing rural populations and rural-to-urban migration have resulted in the decline of rural population and an increasing neglect of the countryside.
                 <br /><br />
                 However, the discovery of radical changes to the rural and urban dynamics in the recent years has prompted architects such as Rem Koolhaas to turn their attention towards the countryside, where he highlights some of these radical changes in his exhibition: 'Countryside & the Future'.
                 The rise of agricultural technology in Japan such as pixel farming and mechanized agriculture has now provided opportunities to manage and even overcome rural development challenges.
                 The Hyper Village project thus seeks to adopt these agricultural technologies to create a post-metropolitan condition through a system of development of Japan’s countryside that envisions a more sustainable and greener development, while creating more communal driven and bonded communities."

    aboutme="I am a Masters degree in Architecture student from Singapore University of Technology and Design. My interest in planning and city development strategies was a major influence in the approach taken for this project under the guidance of 
    Assistant Professor Sam Conrad Joyce from the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar at SUTD. This project has changed my perspectives on the dynamics between the city and countryside, and to speculate what the future holds for urban development."

               Coupled with the decline of rural population, the regions in the countryside have been largely ignored and many changes gone unnoticed."> </text-only>

              The increasing number of people beginning to appreciate the leisure lifestlye away from cities and capability of working remotely shifts the attention towards rural Japan as another viable option for working and living without being
               confined to the city centres."> </text-only>

    <text-only title="Role of agriculture and the rise of agri-tech industry" content="Traditionally, agriculture has been a major part of the rural economy in Japan, providing income and employment for the local community. On a national level, these agricultural communities are crucial for the food security in local produce such as rice, wheat and various vegetables. As more people began to move out into cities, there has been a steady decline in the rural population and also farming community. However, the development of agricultural technology over the recent years has improved productivity of crop farms and adapt to the changes in climate. In Japan, modern farming methods such as cloud monitoring, indoor vertical farming and precision farming has proved the potential of agri-tech in rural development as it not only increased income for crop farmers but also support community businesses and provide employment in the new agri-tech industry.
               The rise of the agri-tech industry has also led to an increase in popularity and viability of community farming for locals seeking for a side income or to interact within the community. In light of the imbalance in development between cities and the countryside, agriculture now serves as a viable tool in the quest for rural development."> </text-only>

    <text-only title="PIXEL FARMS" content="Pixel farming refers the the extended idea of pixel cropping first proposed by Rem Koolhaas as part of his investigation into the countryside and the changes over the years that aims to revitalize the agricultural community
               through new farming methods. Unlike mono agriculture where only a single species of plants are grown, the farmland is divided into cells or 'pixels' that introduces different plants within the same plot to increase productivity and biodiversity. Pixel
               farming takes the idea further by incorporating mechanized agriculture through autonomous bots and drones that allows the user to monitor the condition of the plants remotely and respond to any changs in the environment."> </text-only>

The taller plants harvested during the spring and summer season is located closer to the drone port, followed by the autmn crops and winter crops located along the fringes of the farm surrounded by landscape and trees that provide the neccesary shading for growth."

    <text-only title="Site" content="A small town located along the border of Saitama city was chosen to demonstrate the system of development that can be replicated in most rural areas of Japan. One of the key features of the countryside is the general lack of public amenities and extensive areas of underutilised plots of land. These lands are generally located between residential and light industries. The development of these areas should create more effective connections and transitions between residential and industrial buildings. The introduction of pixel farms into these areas provides a buffer zone that reduce noise levels and improve the quality of the living environment. Most small towns in the countryside also contains large areas of nature and recreational spaces. Roads adjacent and connected to the land parcels are identified as access points to development within the unused lands
