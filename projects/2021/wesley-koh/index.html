    <title-text title="The Path to Sanity: Destigmatizing Mental Health"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis aims to better understand and address the  current realities that influence the design and delivery of  mental wellness, as well as to identify ways to improve  the experiences of the people, be it people with mental health conditions or the general public through the built environment.
    <br><br>  
   The research starts by understanding the current state of  mental health globally and locally, followed by researching  deep	into	stigma	and	how	we	could	destigmatise	and normalise mental  health, to allow rehabilitation and reintegration to foster. In  doing so, fostering rights, inclusion and non-discrimination,  allowing these spaces to be an avenue for people to improve  their mental health, to seek help with dignity and to empower  these individuals to facilitate their return to society."

    title="Site Selection" 
    text="Currently in Singapore, there is a gap in preventive measures. Mental wellness is a continuum and mental health conditions are just one end of the spectrum. Hence, this thesis aims to noramalise mental wellness and my target is the general public as mental health is relevant to everyone and it will be more beneficial to prevent mental health conditions from developing in the long run.
	<br><br>
	For those with mental health conditions, this space will be able to help rehabilitate and empower them with the necessary skillsets to enable them to live independently. People who participate in sports are proven to have better mental health, are more attentive, and are more robust to modern-day stressors. Entertainment has the ability to create desirable states such as relaxation or excitement, as well as a variety of human emotions that enrich daily life. Hence, sports and entertainment will be the main programmes for this thesis.
	<br><br>
	The site selected is Kallang. There are plans by the relevant authorities to turn Kallang into a destination for sports and world-class entertainment. These fits perfectly with the programmes this thesis proposes. In this site, there are many strengths such as being highly connected by public transport, having food and necessities located in close proximity as well as located close to residential areas. The site is also located along the river and has a park connector which make this site accessible."

    title="Site Analysis" 
    text="I went down to site and positioned myself at 4 locations to do some site analysis during the peak hour. As the site is adjacent to a bus stop which is between location A and D as well as an MRT station, there is a usually a high volume of human footfall from location A to D and vice versa. There is a also a good number of cyclists that cycles along the MRT station to access the park connector as indicated by the green path. As the site is currently inaccessible due to COVID control measures, there is not much activities going on except for people who are doing their morning jogs, people that are on the move or those who are waiting for the bus.

	<br><br>
	Tranquil spaces provide restorative environments for urban residents. Hence, I did a soundscape analysis to identify pleasant sounds so that we can amplify them as well as the negative sounds so that we can reduce them. 
	<br><br>
	Location A and D are the most vibrant but have the poorest overall soundscape quality due to the high volume of traffic flow. This is especially so for location D, for being the most annoying due to the sharp beeps from the traffic light at the crossing that goes off all day long in between short intervals. However, it is good to note that the sound pressure level ranges from 60 to 70db most of the time which is still considered moderate.
	<br><br>
	On the other hand, location B and C are the most boring but has the most pleasant soundscape. There are lots of birds chirping and you can even hear the wind which makes that area therapeutic. The only downside at location B is the low frequency sounds from the MRT stationâ€™s HVAC.
	<br><br>
	With this, the site can be divided into the quiet zone as well as the busy zone where more private programmes can be fitted into the quiet zone and the public programmes to the busy zone.
	<br><br>
	There is an obvious lack of sports and entertainment programs. Although there are coffeeshops at this site, by considering cafes and bars as new programs can inject new life into the area as it attracts the younger crowd.

    title="'Live, Work & Play' Ecosystem"
    text="This is the list of proposed programmes and they can be categorised into programmes that are for everyone as well as those tailored specifically for people with mental health conditions.
	<br><br>
	Part of this project aims to create an ecosystem of live, work and play, where rehabilitation and empowerment can be fostered for the people with mental health conditions. These individuals can take up a variety of crafts such as painting and carpentry, making use of the maker space as their workspace and after that, sell or exhibit their crafts in the exhibition hall and marketplace. This is when you will see a diffusion of the general public and those with mental health conditions, to coexist within the same space. Hence, this synergy aims to educate the public, to let the public experience for themselves that people with mental health conditions can just be anyone and look perfectly normal, and you do not need to feel uncomfortable. These normalises mental health conditions and destigmatise it.
	<br><br>
	The element of play is not just important for those with mental health conditions but it is also the main attractor for the general public.

    title="Programme"
    text="Aqua spin and spin are one of the hottest fitness trends in Singapore right now. It incorporates both sports and entertainment, which is something like a fitness night club but can be conducted during the day as well. By placing this program in the atrium of the busy zone, it will become the main attraction. This space can also be converted into a cinema at night which will attract families and dates to come down as well.
	<br><br>
	By placing some of the makers space above this social program, it can attract those who are working on their crafts to actually come down and socialise.
	<br><br>
	Finally, we will have the quiet zone where it contains programs that are more quiet such as residential spaces for the individuals with mental health conditions who are working at the makers spaces or even spa and onsen where the general public can access at the ground floor

	title="Strategies"
	content="It is important to create an environment that normalises the abnormal. Such as blurring the boundary between targeted programs for the mental health and the general public as well as creating a space that sets a new normal for everyone. 
	<br><br>
	Active lifestyles afford benefits beyond the physical well being. They also inform our mental well being. Other than challenging our bodies and provide new movements, it also provides a variety of options for users to prevent the repetition of activities and movement, making the usual circulation more fun and engaging, which benefits our mental wellbeing.
	<br><br>
	Relaxation is important to prevent a mental breakdown or episode from occurring. Plants are known to be therapeutic, and it creates a tranquil environment. 
	<br><br>
	Access to natural daylight is as important as well as it controls the occurrence of sleepiness and wakefulness in our daily routine. 
	<br><br>
	Apart from daylight, the field of vision is also an important passive surveillance strategy in Newmanâ€™s Defensible Space Theory. Programs are stacked in manner where individuals can look into other programs. This will create a sense of safety which is important to reduce mental stress and it also creates interests between people from different spaces and this can foster socialisation.
	<br><br>
	Lastly, privacy is very important for our mental health. Different people can be triggered in varying degrees of privacy. Some just want to be alone, others need a source of distraction. By having flexible spaces to create or remove privacy such as the workspace, or static spaces with no specific programs that provides different degree if privacy can serve as a space of escape during an episode."></text-only>
