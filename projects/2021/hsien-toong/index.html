    main-title="Summary"
    summary="My project looks at the problem of social isolation which was magnified by the pandemic. Though its effects were prevalent before COVID, it will likely persist even after it. I am looking at high density housing which designs had arguably contributed to making social isolation an entrenched problem. I will propose strategies to adapt existing high-rised homes to improve communality while allowing for physical separation in event of pandemics without the worst effects of isolation."

    title="Introduction" 
    text="During the pandemic in 2020, we have unfortunately seen a rise of mental health issues surfacing. While physical isolation was the only way to curb the spread before vaccines were developed, lifestyle changes happened, and prolonged durations of staying indoors were necessary. Though effective in curbing the spread, it is at the expense of the mental health of people, and experts are accrediting isolation as the cause of increased anxiety and depression.
    <br><br>          
     Since I am on the topic on isolation, I did a few experiential studies which are a series of recordings and documentation of the multiple experiences where I was required to self-isolate. During these experiences, I recorded my movement, my level of attentiveness, the views that I have as well as the duration that I took to be in each point or position."

    title="Ethnographic approach"
    text="I took the ethnographic approach to record my experience which includes a 24-hour timelapse and multiple manual notes that I took concurrently."

    title="SUTD Hostel Room" 
    text="The first study is of myself being in my Hostel Room during the 5 days of isolation, being in a 10 metre squared room. Overlayed on the sketch of the room are some notes of how I utilize the space and the circulation paths I took. Next an abstract diagram of the compiled information that I recorded, the solid black lines were the circulation paths, the size of the circle represents the duration that I was at that positions and the saturation of the circles represent the rigour of the activity or the level of attentiveness. Which is why the circle on the bed is a very faded colour, because sleeping is the least rigorous activity. At the bottom of the diagram I also included a bar to give a sense of scale for the duration while walking around the room."

    title="SHN Hotel Room" 
    text="The second study is my experience in the 20 square metred hotel room which I have to stay in for a stay home notice which is 21 days. And as we can se in the centre of the room has a solid orange, this is because the area was relatively large and empty, so I was able to utilize the space for my daily exercises. Also as you might have noticed on the desk I indicated views from my laptop, because it literally keeps me occupied and engaged in activites beyond the physical room, such as video calls and internet browsing, where I am connected to spaces beyond the physical room."

    text="Next is a drawing of another scale, where I recorded my experience in the SUTD campus. And here we have the Abstract diagram, same solid lines are the circulation paths I took, dotted lines are the unobstructed views, size of the circle is the duration I was at the point, and the colours in this case represent the height, green means ground floor, blue means 2nd floor amd purple is the 9th floor."
