    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="Earth has been one of the most basic building materials since the beginning of human existence, and till today, this material has been used in housing projects, accounting for over a third of the worldâ€™s population living in them. (UNESCO, n.d.)

    <br><br>  It is an easily sourced material, with great economic and thermal advantages. In addition, earth is a versatile and sustainable form of construction that impinges as little as possible on the environment. When a building becomes redundant, its earth components can simply be demolished and returned to the ground. On the other hand, at a typical construction site, as much as 30% of all building materials delivered to site would end up as waste (Osmani, 2011). This brings to attention the need to build with sustainable methods and reduce construction waste.

    <br><br>  The use of earth for construction is largely used in developing countries, mainly due to the lower cost of construction. On the other hand, in developed cities, there is a decline in the use of earth over the years due to the emergence of new materials and techniques, coupled with an attitude of disdain towards earth as a building material.

    title="Population" 
    text="Ninomiya Town was developed 50 years ago as a new town, where 72ha of hills have been reborn as detached houses, apartment houses, and shopping streets.
    Now that many years have passed since the construction, coupled with the ageing of the residence and the ageing infrastructure, the role of the former new town is about to end. Hence in 2016, 
    the Ninomiya reorganization project was being set up with an aim to revitalize the complex by creating new attractions for housing and the area. Being known as an ageing town in terms of both 
    its population and infrastructure, this projects taps on the existing infrastructure as well as introducing new programmes and activities that readapt these spaces.

    title="Programmes" 
    text="Despite the many programmes and facilities around Ninomiya town, there seems to be a lack of a centralised space that caters for the ageing population,
 as well as a place that can promote family bonding. A core is needed for such a programme to provide a gathering space for people to enjoy. Making use of the strong cultural
context of Ninomiya Town, with programmes like the farmers market, communal gardening, communal dining, we can see how the locals are connected to food- from the beginning of its cycle
where they grow their own produce, right to the end where they gather to have a meal. Hence by using food as a connector and anchor, i want to create a core where people can gather and have access to the different programmes centered around food. This new typology aims
to give locals a sense of purpose, ritual and belonging.
At the same time, it is needed to provide care and support for the elderly who might feel alone and vulnerable as more people decide to leave the town. 
This programme aims to bring people of different ages to engage in communal work such as farming and cooking. In addition, by integrating a clinic to this centre, the elderly would be more encouraged 
to visit refularly for consultations and enojy a healthy lifestyle. <br><br>Similar to the Japanese tea house where earth is used to create a natural
 environment for the programme of the tea ceremony, it coincides with the nature of the programme, where earth architecture is used to tie and integrate these 
programmes to create a formal community setting. These three main programmes would be able to benefit from     one another and encourage a healthier and meaningful lifestyle.

    title="Massing Strategy" 
    text="My massing takes inspiration from the Chashitsu, a traditional Japanese tea house made using earth. These 
 tea houses are generally small with a 3m x 3m layout, which creates an intimate space for opportunities to interact. By adapting this spatial
quality to a circular form, a cyclindrical module was formed. A circle represents togetherness, harmony and balance in Japan's culture, which resonates with the 
aim of my thesis- to bring energy and life to ageing suburban towns. Hence, using these cyclindrical modules would create an intimate space for the locals to enjoy.

     <text-only title="Floor Plans" content="Starting from the top, at the highest level, the roof is used as a community garden where the residents can grow and harvest crops, and use them in the cooking school etc.<br><br>
    The third level is used for physical activity, where the indoor areais used for activities such as a gym, dance and music studios, where they can exercise and bond with the locals. The green outdoor spaces 
is used for gardening, and while waiting for the crops to grow, the space is transformed to an outdoor activity space where people can gather in groups 
for outdoor exercises and physical activity. <br><br> The second floor is used to house a cooking school where residents can come over to prepare meals using the plants they harvest. They would be able to discuss 
and share their recipes with one another, creating bonds between the residents. In addition a healthcare clinic with consultation rooms are also located on the second floor. The clinic allows the elderly residents 
to learn about healthcare while visiting the cooking school at the same time, destigmatizing the seniors who have to visit regularly for check ups. <br><br> On the ground level, open spaces can be used for farmer
 markets where the residents can gather and sell their food or produce. These multi-purpose spaces can also be used to host performances and talks during festivals. The indoor spaces are communal dining and conference 
spaces where residents can meet up and host talks or events

    <text-only title="Construction Technique" content="The material I am using is stabilised earth brick. It is an advanced construction method that surpasses the strength standards in Japan. This method was adapted from the earth brick residence built in 2008. where 100% of their materials are sourced locally and 
is also 100% natural such that it can return to nature once it has served its purpose. The diagram illustrates the process of creating a brick from scratch, right from creating the mold to shape these bricks. These bricks are then stacked on top of each other through a lego-like method.
