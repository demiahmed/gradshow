    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis aims to critically challenge the norms of living in dense urban cities. With more people adapting to a new way of living – the more remote working style, it allows for more freedom of movement, to seek for new experiences and opportunities all around the world. With this new normal, it brings about far reaching possibilities for urban centres and rural landscapes.
    <br><br>  
    Could a new concept of cities be formed where opportunities of urban lifestyles do not merely exist in urbanised city centres but also spread into the more rural landscape. People can experience both rural and urban living all in one, capitalising on the economic flows of main cities and the resources present in the landscapes."

    aboutme="Rachel is a Masters of Architecture graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design. Her passion for arts and design started from a young age, from hand-crafting to drawing to video-editing, she has picked up different interests and skillsets along the way, and hence grown great interest in Architecture today. Her thesis revolves around a new narrative of future cities, creating more resource-efficient and sustainable cities."

    title="Introduction" 
    text="Cities are urban centres, they are the heart of collaboration, productivity, new ideas and culture. Cities are the largest urban form. They rely on economic flows and the movement of resources for sustainability. However, cities today have been threatened. They face increased global uncertainty and change, which places pressure on urban sustainability. 
<br><br>
The major global factors that contribute to these pressures are economic change, scarcity of resources, rapid technological and social change, and environmental and climate change effects. These drivers of change pose danger to the various sectors that are important for urban sustainability such as food, water, energy, transport and waste. Even with these pressures, people still flock to urbanised city centres, leaving behind their rural counterparts.
<br><br>
The shift from rural to urban resulted in the emergence of the megacity, which are cities with populations of 10 million and above. As shown by the yellow dots on the map. The newer up and coming megacities are located in Asia and Africa.
<br><br>
The existence of the megacities in developing countries have brought about significant problems in terms of poverty, climate change, inequality, and the lack of resources and infrastructure. These problems occur as populations increase faster than cities can manage, resulting in a population of people living in slums within these city centres. "

    title="Urban Metabolism" 
    text="Urban Metabolism’ looks at cities as complex natural ecosystems. It is the concept that cities behave
similarly to living organisms in terms of their biological processes.
<br><br>
Cities take up less than 2% of the Earth’s surface, however, according to UN Habitat, cities consume 78% of the world’s available energy and produce more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. With the further increase in populations moving from rural to urbanised areas, generating climate problems and social problems.
<br><br>
In this thesis it is important to assess the relationship between the environment and the internal dynamics of resource exchange among components and sectors. Reducing waste and emissions is the only way to fight against climate change. By utilising the ‘Urban Metabolism’ framework to account for the inflows and outflows of a city with its relation to population, resource availability, and environmental carrying capacity and establishing an understanding of the relations between societies, the environment, and energy flows can future designs be more sustainable."

    text="The goal is to establish a base within these resource-rich regions and create a self-sustainable megastructure for cities to model after and repopulate, in order to give back the space to nature.
<br><br>
The initial test bed for this thesis is Indonesia, mainly within the Kalimantan region. Taking this as a starting point, future satellite megastructures can be modelled after this, around different resource-rich regions in the world."

    title="Production Phase" 
    text="Firstly, in the production phase, the focus is the sourcing and production of building materials for construction. Natural resources are split into renewable and non-renewable resources. In order to reduce the embodied carbon of the building, it is important to reduce the use of depletable resources that are harmful to our environment. Hence, within this chart we look further into timber production as the main material resource of the building.
<br><br>
The building and construction industry contributes to 39% of global carbon emissions with 11% of it being embodied carbon emissions. In the long run embodied carbon emissions has a more lasting impact as buildings become more energy efficient. The greatest contributor to embodied carbon emissions are the materials used and how they are produced. From mining to smelting and burning of non-renewable resources, it depletes the earth’s natural resource and generates unwanted carbon emissions.
<br><br>
Hence in order to reduce emissions, it is therefore necessary to use more sustainable methods of production and to use low-carbon products. Wood is continually regenerative and less harmful to the environment when sourced and logged appropriately. Forests are carbon sequesters and which store carbon within the trees. The timber used for construction stores the carbon from the atmosphere."

    title="<i>The Site</i>"
    text="The site chosen is located in an almost fully forested area with its natural resources being timber from the trees, and water from its rivers. Primary roads connect around the site for access into and out of the site.
<br><br>
The site boundary, red-dotted lines, is within the non-forested area.
<br><br>
The location of the site is important as it provides us with the knowledge of the locations of nearest roads where materials can be transported and nearest forests where timber can be procured."

    <text-image 
    title="Construction Phase" 
    text="Other than the materials used, embodied carbon is also affected by the construction process of the building. with heavy machinery used and transport to and from the site, it generates significant carbon emissions. Hence through the understanding of the construction process the aim is to ease the methods of construction through designing modular and flexible building components for adaptability and ease of production. Diagrams below show the circular process and the components within the system

    title="Use Phase" 
    text="After looking into the production and construction phases for ways to reduce embodied carbon, the next is use of the building and how to make the building more energy efficient. As more buildings move towards becoming carbon-zero or carbon-negative, operational carbon emissions are reduced. The main needs of people within the building are energy, water, food, and goods. These flows are mapped to form closed looped systems within the building where the waste becomes recycled or reused for other purposes."

    title="<i>The Programs</i>"
    text="These programs are organised within the building to maximise the efficiency, where water collection and treatment is along the slopping portions of the building, energy storage is at the base of the building where solar panels can be retrofitted on the roofs, and a mixed used program will house the residential, offices and leisure spaces within the high rise portion of the structure."

The permanent structures take into account the possibilities of expansion and degrowth, and demolition and regrowth, where components can be removed discarded, while the main structure remains for nature to take over."
