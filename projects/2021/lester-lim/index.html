    <title-text title="Reimagining a neo-suburban future for Detroit"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="Detroit is known as the Motor-city because of its once-powerful automotive industry. What was once a booming metropolis is now a hollow city, with vacant buildings,
	plots of land and decaying neighbourhoods whose population has fled to the suburbs. The sprawling nature of the city is conducive to its urban decay. <br><br> 
	This thesis seeks to redefine the American dream of Suburbia, by re-adapting the abandoned Packard Automotive Plant into a Suburb of the future. 
	It also draws on themes of industrial manufacturing and home ownership, which have beome inherent to Detroit’s many problems. <br><br> 
	Set in a future where electric and autonomous vehicles are the norm, this neo-suburb will seek to integrate spaces for cars and humans, 
	as well as redefine architectural mobility and autonomy. This posits a new form of urban/architecture space where humans and electric vehicles exist in closer contact 
	than in the past - and seeks to explore the possibilities and understand the challenges of this condition, crafting a new future for the Motorcity of tomorrow.
    <br><br>"

    aboutme="Lester is a final year undergraduate in the Architecture and Sustainable Design course. 
	His stint at WY-TO Architects as an junior architectural designer involved multidisciplinary designs, from exhibitions and installations to social housing. 
	His studies and work experience has shaped his interest in humanistic and social architecture. 
	He believes that modern developments should still retain character, whilst driven by eco-sustainability, ethical values and implementing new materials and 
	new technologies to provide a better quality of life for people.

	There are existing architectural projects exploring the new conditions that can be afforded, from autonomous living, to drive up spaces, travelling spaces, and economical usage. These advancements all gives ur grounds to rethink the way we build our cities and spaces.

    text="When it comes to living in America, we think of the suburbs, which is fraught with urban and sustainability issues, as Im sure many of you are familiar with. 
	It has come to represent the endless, problematic growth and sprawl model of development in American cities, as well as political and social issues."

	built upon a vicious cycle of automobile depency, caused by the post-war industry and baby boom."

    title="How can we redefine this model of development?"
    text="The urban and social characteristics of the suburbs has been long entrenched in the American way of life, represented here by Levittown, 
	one of the pioneering suburban model of development created by William Levitt in the late 50s. It features sprawling, single family homes made affordable via cheap mass 
	production and attractive mortgage loans, driving masses of Americans to purchase these homes. It was the American dream to have your own piece of property and yard, 
	along with a car in these car-centric developments. These suburbs are often characterised by big box stores, with even larger parking lots to accommodate the cars ."

	which hold both the housing and residential lifts, with recreational programs tucked underneath for easy access on both sides.

Ample public space will be provided, and the repurposed plant will be used for commercial purposes like the big box stores that characterises suburbs,
 as well as for manufacturing the house units and extensions which can be transported up via the hypercore’s funicular lift."

	to an inhabitable infrastructure for the city, whilst tackling some of the many issues which plagues the city. 
	This is a counter-thesis to the American sprawl model of growth, in hopes of giving back the land to the environment instead of constantly taking more."
