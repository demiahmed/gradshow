    <title-text title="Reimagining a neo-suburban future for Detroit"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Abstract"
    summary="Detroit is known as the Motor-city because of its once-powerful automotive industry. What was once a booming metropolis is now a hollow city, with vacant buildings,
	plots of land and decaying neighbourhoods whose population has fled to the suburbs. The sprawling nature of the city is conducive to its urban decay. <br><br> 
	This thesis seeks to redefine the American dream of Suburbia, by re-adapting the abandoned Packard Automotive Plant into a Suburb of the future. 
	It also draws on themes of industrial manufacturing and home ownership, which have beome inherent to Detroit’s many problems. <br><br> 
	Set in a future where electric and autonomous vehicles are the norm, this neo-suburb will seek to integrate spaces for cars and humans, 
	as well as redefine architectural mobility and autonomy. This posits a new form of urban/architecture space where humans and electric vehicles exist in closer contact 
	than in the past - and seeks to explore the possibilities and understand the challenges of this condition, crafting a new future for the Motorcity of tomorrow.

	His stint at WY-TO Architects as an junior architectural designer involved multidisciplinary designs, from exhibitions and installations to social housing. 
	His studies and work experience has shaped his interest in humanistic and social architecture. 
	He believes that modern developments should still retain character, whilst driven by eco-sustainability, ethical values and implementing new materials and

	built upon a vicious cycle of automobile depency, caused by the post-war industry and baby boom."

	<text-only title="How can we redefine this model of development?" 
	
	content="The urban and social characteristics of the suburbs has been long entrenched in the American way of life, represented here by Levittown, 
	one of the pioneering suburban model of development created by William Levitt in the late 50s. It features sprawling, single family homes made affordable via cheap mass 
	production and attractive mortgage loans, driving masses of Americans to purchase these homes. It was the American dream to have your own piece of property and yard, 
	along with a car in these car-centric developments. These suburbs are often characterised by big box stores, with even larger parking lots to accommodate the cars ."> </text-only>

	suffering from limited resources, Density is destiny for the sake of efficient allocation of thesev resources and safety."

    title="The idea of Living Streets"
    text="So my thesis questions if the new form of mobility explained earlier on can stitch spaces back together? 
	For this I’m looking at the idea of Woonerfs in the Netherlands, which translate to Living streets, 
	Where suburban neighbourhoods are far denser and sustainable, with common front yards and shared spaces for humans and vehicles to inhabit. This is crucial due
	to the fact that in typical metropolitan developments, vast amounts of building area are set aside for parking requirements, creating large, banal spaces that often feel dangerous 
	and uninhabitable."
	
	></image-text>
	
	
	<text-only title="Introducing the Packard Estates" content="The resulting form is a terracing groundscraper structure that seeks to bring and take back the streets for the 
	people in this industrial wasteland, along with attempting to establish a vertical suburban form instead of resorting to skyscrapers, which are often criticized at 
	alienating people from street life and the city, as explained by Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau."

	<text-only title="Throughout the years, tall buildings have had monopoly over designers and property owners. They continue to rise higher, with skylines in many cities now bristling with competing forms reaching upward, indifferent to people and context. 
	In their 1995 manifesto, S, M, L, XL, Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau explained that this indifference is a natural consequence of contemporary large-scale architecture. 
	“Bigness [is] incapable of establishing relationships with the classical city . . .” it “no longer needs the city; it competes with the city. . .” and
	“It is no longer part of any urban tissue.” The result is that “the street has become the residue,” and people seem to matter hardly at all."

	underneath for easy access on both sides. Ample public space will be provided, and the repurposed plant will be used for commercial purposes like 
	the big box stores that characterises suburbs, as well as for manufacturing the house units and extensions which can be transported up via the hypercore’s
