    main-title="Endangerment of Corals in the world"
    summary="The impact of global warming is changing our oceanic environment, threatening the survival of coral reefs, known to be “the rainforest of the ocean” (National Ocean Service, 2020). It is speculated that all coral reefs could possibly die off and become extinct by the year 2050 due to coral bleaching (TruthOut, 2017) The thesis recognizes the symbiotic relationship between corals and humans and the urgent need for intervention in coral protection and aims to investigate the role of architecture in alleviating coral endangerment and participating in coral restoration efforts. " 

    student-title="Tension between Land Reclamation and Marine Protection in Singapore"
    aboutme="Singapore is geographically located in the tropical equatorial region and part of the Coral Triangle which holds the highest abundance of coral species. Being a small country, land reclamation is one of the few solutions for Singapore to achieve more land space and protection against erosion. Singapore adopts a “hundred or zero” approach in conservation marine biodiversity by separating regions of land reclamation and marine protected areas. Many corals has been lost due to land reclamation developments of which include significant interventions such as the Ayer group islands, expansion of Sentosa Island and construction around Semakau Island. (Peter A. Todd S. L., 2014) This thesis seeks the opportunity to challenge and further develop the new polder framework to create more ecological coastline that not only strengthens the polder shoreline defences integrated with land reclamation, but also to hold marine industrial and human recreational and learning activities."


    student-title="Design Concept"
    aboutme="The thesis research highlighted the importance of interconnectivity of coastal systems and the complexity of the intertidal ecosystem. This means that shorelines and coastlines does not exist as a single boundary layer but exist in a multi-layered relationship with other offshore ecosystems to form a coastal ecology. The design angle in this proposal is to explore the layering and meandering strategy to achieve coral protection, by providing different typology of lagoon spaces and buffer zones to create habitable condition to restore and enhance biodiversity while creating an extended waterfront design for humans to enjoy.

    title="Masterplan Strategy" 
    text="<br/>The overall masterplan is a voxelated landscape that is parametrically designed to achieve optimal environmental quality for coral and human habitation using modules and blocks of at different scale, providing flat surfaces and eliminating slopes which are unfavorable and not ideal for coral growth and survival. This strategy begins at the dike, extending to the seabed and follows through on land to create the same language. Different regions such as the lagoon zones, inner surf zones, breakwater zones, shoaling zones and water runoff zones are subjected to different intensity and degree of voxelation<br/> "
