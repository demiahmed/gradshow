    main-title="Project Narrative and Context"
    summary="Singapore is geographically located in the tropical equatorial region and part of the Coral Triangle which holds the highest abundance of coral species. Looking into the past, many corals has been lost due to land reclamation developments of which include significant interventions such as the Ayer group islands, expansion of Sentosa Island and construction around Semakau Island. (Peter A. Todd S. L., 2014) Being a small country, land reclamation is one of the few solutions for Singapore to achieve more land space and protection against erosion. Land reclaimed earlier were initially transferred through soil transfers from hills while seafloors are dredged. Over time, they imported sand from neighbouring countries due to severe shortage of land resources (Murphy, 2013). 

More recently, Singapore investigated and adopted a Dutch strategy using empoldering for polder development land reclamation at Pulau Tekong to be constructed by 2022. This method greatly reduces the amount of sand needed because it makes use of the construction of a dyke, network of drains, water pumping systems and canals to divide the waters and reclaimed lands. (Housing and Development Board, 2016) However, this thesis proposes a possible area of improvement to this new polder framework in developing a more ecological coastline that not only strengthens the polder shoreline defences but also to provide an aesthetically-pleasant waterfront landscape design for human to enjoy. 

<br/><br/> The chosen site for this project is Pulau Tekong of which 810 hectare of land will be reclaimed for military training purposes. (Housing and Development Board, 2016) The thesis project will be developing the outskirts of the polder which is currently protected by a dike that spans 10km in length, 15m in width and 6m above the sea level. (Housing and Development Board, 2016)

    aboutme="The research from the thesis summarises to conclude the importance of interconnectivity of coastal systems and the complexity of the intertidal ecosystem. This means that shorelines and coastlines does not exist as a single boundary layer but exist in a multi-layered relationship with other offshore ecosystems to form a coastal ecology. The design angle in this proposal is to explore the layering effect of coastal design and how it can particularly be applied to the polder system, and potentially other coasts subjected to hard engineering, to restore and enhance biodiversity while creating an extended waterfront design for humans to enjoy. 
	<br/><br/> Pulau Tekong is an offshore island located at the far east of Singapore, with facilities and developments for national military trainins. The design proposal will be a pilot testing ground for coral restoration and agricultural plantation monitored by research lab, while offering military personnels a waterfront park environment for training and relaxation. As such, programs like diving, aquaculture, public enjoyment and coral farming will be considered in this project. "

    title="Computation Strategy" 
    text="This subdivision algorithm is a technique for increasing number of faces in 3D geometries evenly, and eventually smoothening the entire form. It starts by assigning face points at the center of every face  and edge points as the average of 2 adjacent face points and 2 original end points. With that, the original end points can be moved in the average direction of all the new points created and form a new vertex point. These leads to new face points and new edge points which then defines new faces encloshed by edges and the process continues to repear itself to form a smoother mesh. (Wikipedia, 2021)
	<br/> <br/> Differential Line Growth is a 2-dimensional variation of Differential Growth Algorithm exploring how a line can fold on itself using processes like winding, undulating, buckling to extend its length to create a meandering effect following simple motion rules and logical patterning of subdivisions. The process involves a series of nodes connected by edges to form paths. These nodes experience attraction forces with its neighbouring nodes but experience repulsion forces with all other nodes such that a minimum distance is maintained. This would result in an alignment force such that each node is resting midway between its neighbour nodes to form as straight of a line possible. (Webb, 2019) Nodes will continually drift further apart, while new injections and processes like cell division, surface tension, and pressure. New nodes are injected into the system at a faster rate from the rate of expansion due to the attraction and repulsion forces so the overall volume of the system increases. These new injection nodes can vary in terms of criteis for vary growth patterns. (Webb, 2019)"

<br/> Dike Architecture to create wave-like architecture forms to provide seascape view from inside the polder
<br/> Programs held in these infrastructures can be aquaculture farming, onshore coral nurseries, research centers, coral monitoring hub, marine gallery and diving hub for military training.
<br/> <br/>
Dike River to serve as onshore, intensive, more regulated and controlled environments for coral farming and aquaculture cultivation.
<br/> <br/>
Floating pontoon allows people to walk on pontoons to monitor coral growth and for diving. 
<br/> Floating pontoon can be made of pneumatic structures with pop up inflatable pavilions to support outdoor programs
<br/> Floating pontoons can be made up of modular units constantly added to expand the chain and reach out to a wider area, similar to differential growth phenomena. 
<br/> Floating pontoons provide partial shade to corals thaat prefer lower temperatures.
<br/> <br/>
Underwater Coral Nusery 
(Pentagon Fractal Terrocotta Tiles)
<br/> To cultivate corals by providing complex habitats, to restore coral and marine biodiversity.
<br/> Corals serve as breakwater, protecting the dike and polder coastline.
<br/> Infrastructure for artificial reef mimics mangroves form and traps sedimentations.
<br/> <br/>
Cantilevered Roofs
<br/> To provide partial shade to corals and humans in the waterfront. 
<br/> <br/>
Overall Masterplanning
<br/> To create dynamic, landscape on the polder edge and elevated dike, while expanding the waterfront for ecological, industrial and recreational purposes.
