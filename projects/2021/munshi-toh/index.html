    "The effects of Urban Heat Island (UHI) is becoming an increasingly critical topic. The worsening effects of global warming and rapid increase in the world's population further propogates the intensity of UHI especially within high-density cities.
    <br><br>
    Much of the existing mitigation strategies today provide prescriptions in the form of urban morphological guidelines. While these may be useful in the design of new cities, these do little as strategies for existing built-up cities.
    <br><br>
    This thesis aims to propose utilising evaporative cooling as a suitable UHI mitigation strategy that can be implemented into existing built-up cities with minimal disruption to the urban fabric. Evaporative cooling is a cooling method utilising the absorption of energy during the phase change of water from liquid to gaseous states."

    title="Introduction"

    text="
    The relatively recent advancements in medical technology has led to lower mortality rates, extending the average lifespan and improving birth survival rates. This has led to a steep increase in the world’s population over the last several decades. The start of this increase coincided with the start of the Industrial revolution in 1760 and since then, the world population has grown more than ten-fold.
    <br><br>
    In addition, the increase in affluence has further contributed to urban sprawl where larger percentages of the population are moving into the cities to work and live. As such, the urban cities are growing larger and denser while the buildings are getting taller and more compact to meet the spatial demands. Closely packed buildings causes a higher concentration of human activities, leading to worsening urban heat island.
    <br><br>
    Cooling Singapore describes UHI as the difference in air temperature between rural and urban areas. Major causes of UHI include the extensive use of heat trapping and impermeable materials, the lack of vegetation, high concentrations of anthropogenic heat and poor dissipation of heat due to poor wind flow.
    <br><br>
    With global warming on the rise, UHI is becoming an increasingly troubling issue with adverse effects. Chan et al (2010) reported a 1.8% increased mortality in relation to 1°C mean daily temperature over 28.2°C. This affirms urgency in the need to mitigate UHI."

        <h2>Urban Morphology</h2>
        Urban morphology plays a crucial role in UHI due to its influence on wind porosity. This can be seen through the large amounts of research that has gone into studying urban morphology and prescribing urban design guidelines to counter UHI. These is usually in the form of building and urban typologies relating to building shape, size and placement. However, while these prescriptions are effective for the designing of new cities, they do little in the improvement of existing cities, where changes can be difficult and costly. Mitigation strategies should be focused on improving existing built up cities to be more resilient.
        <br><br>
        Urban morphology provides useful insight into the microclimatic conditions in relation to the built environment. Data such as Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR) can be calculated to visualise the urban density at a higher resolution than generic numerical data across regions, while Frontal Area Density (FAD) provides an estimation of the pedestrian level wind conditions. Climatic data extracted from official weather stations provides a way to validate GCR and FAD visualisations prior to identifying areas of interests in relation to UHI.

    title="Proposed Strategy"

    text="
    Urban acupuncture is a design concept taking inspiration from traditional Chinese medicine involving strategic pinpricks to improve a larger meridian. Applied in the urban context, a strategically located design has the potential to provide a larger area of effect and benefits. Implementing urban acupuncture in existing cities is useful due to the minimal disruption it causes to the existing urban fabric when applied.
    <br><br>
    Coupled with a cooling method such as evaporative cooling, a cooling strategy has the potential to be deployed in an 'area of effect' that extends beyond the immediate site of the design intervention. Evaporative cooling is a cooling method utilising the absorption of energy during the phase change of water from liquid to gaseous states.
    <br><br>
    Urban morphological studies shall provide a methodological way of identifying the site of intervention through a multi-scale analysis."

    title="Region"

    text="
    Humidity is shown to have an inverse relationship with the rate of evaporation. As such, the climate of interest shall be within the equatorial climatic region, with high temperatures and humidity. Singapore is an ideal country within the equatorial region with a high population density as well, associating to higher concentrations of human activity, and urban density – aspects of higher UHI intensity.
    <br><br>
    Singapore has a relative humidity that varies throughout the day between 60% and above 90%, a relatively uniform temperature with highs of 31°C to 33°C and a high population density of 8,286 people per km2"

        Most readily available maps display density in the form of the number of people within the  districts. However, when considering urban morphology, building footprint would provide a better estimation of wind flow and thus, UHI intensity. Hence, GCR and FAD visualisations provide better representations of UHI by considering the building's footprint. For this study, the maps are computed into a 500m grid utilising GIS data.

    Areas of higher density can also be identified and rationalised. Key typologies associated with areas of high densities are industrial buildings, landed housing, and conserved buildings.
    <br><br>
    Industrial buildings are closely packed together due to the smaller building setback requirements set by The Urban Redevelopment Authority. Landed housing is also closely packed side by side with narrow roads running though the areas. Conserved buildings such as shophouses tend to be closely packed together due to its joined typology. In addition, such buildings were constructed with older regulations with potentially smaller setback requirements.
    <br><br>
    These 3 building types, while placed compactly together, are generally buildings of low aspect ratios with low height. This maintains a relatively high skyview factor allowing for better heat dissipation. As such, taller buildings such as skyscrapers within the CBD pose higher risk of impeding wind flow."

    title="Weather Stations"

    text="
    Understanding of the micro scale climatic conditions is important to understand the building’s impact on its micr climate. Readily available climatic data provides a generic estimation of the conditions for the larger area, which may not be as accurate for a more specific study. UHI requires a higher resolution of climatic data specific to the urban site’s micro climate.
    <br><br>
    Extracting the raw data from official weather stations provide high resolution readings per minute or per 5 minutes. This data can be further analysed and studied to understand the site conditions through site specific visualisations such as wind rose diagrams which can be used to validate FAD findings.

    The micro-scale simulation tries to located an area with good windflow within the larger of poor windflow. TThe reason for selecting the area of good wind flow within the larger region of poor wind flow is reinforced by the concept of urban acupuncture, where implementing a design within the site of good wind flow could potentially spread that effect outwards to the areas of poorer wind flow."

        Between the different building typologies amongst the tall skyscrapers in the district, cylindrical shaped buildings do not obstruct the wind flow as much as an angular building of the same frontal area density.<br>
        <br>

        As such, a cylindrical building within a larger area of poor wind flow potential has the best potential to provide an area of effect and spread the benefits of evaporative cooling to a larger area.

        1) Water Wall, <br>

        <h2>Water Wall</h2>
        <h4>Experiment 1 - Surface Temperature</h4>
        <img style="width:33%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/ExperimentLocation.jpg">

        <img style="width:33%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/SurfaceTempChart.jpg"><br>
        This experiment aims to provide insight into the thermal absorption properties of concrete, the primary heat trapping material in the CBD. Using thermocouple probes, the exterior and interior surface temperatures of a wall are monitored over a 24-hour duration. Both interior and exterior surface temperatures remained mostly above the recorded air temperature, and even continued increasing after the air temperature had peaked.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Experiment 2 - Concrete Thermal Absorption</h4>
        <img style="width:22%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/ConcreteAbsorb.jpg">
        <img style="width:45%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/ConcreteAbsorbChart.jpg">

        <img style="width:13%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/ThermalImage2.gif"><br>
        The potential of material cooling via wetting is tested in the experiment. Using a 50W heating lamp, a casted block of concrete is warmed and its top and bottom surface temperatures recorded until it peaked. Then, the block is sprayed with water for 10 minutes while still being heated by the lamp, before it was left to be heated to its peak temperature again. This experiment showed that wetting the concrete not only had immediate cooling, but it also slowed down the concrete’s rate of heat absorption as well. A wetting cycle of 2.5 hours between each spray could be feasible.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Placement</h4>

        The placement of the water walls would ideally be in the direction of higher solar irradiance. Based on the solar analysis using the Ladybug plugin in Rhino-Grasshopper, this shall be in the NNW and SSE directions of the building.

        Contextless misting simulations provides an optimal wind speed for evaporative cooling to be feasible. With this data, an array of misting systems can be located onto the site where the simulated wind speed is within the optimal range between 0.5/s to 2m/s.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Placement Process</h4>
        <img style="width:100%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/PlacementProcess.jpg">
        1) Windflow is simulated for the street scale boundary<br>
        2) Using a C# written script in Rhino Grasshopper, regions with the optimal wind speed can be identified by points<br>
        3) Understanding that a misting system cannot be placed on the road, points within those regions are removed<br>
        4) Misting systems placed too far away from the site may become inefficient due to the loss of pressure associated with extended water transport distances. A 200m radius area of effect is identified<br>
        5) The points are grouped and enclosed within boundaries. If the boundary area is too small, it is removed<br>
        6) Placement points are scattered within the boundaries. The number of placements within each boundary is dependent on the area of boundary divided by an area of effect per misting system
        <br><br>
        <h4>Simulation</h4>
        <img style="width:100%;padding-bottom: 35px;" src="./data/Images/MistSimulation.jpg">
        The simulation results showed slight decrease in air temperature. While the drop in temperature is not much, the simulation was done with only 20 misting systems across a 200m radius from the site. A larger number of misting systems would likely provide better cooling results. The misting systems are placed at a 4m height from the ground for efficient water dispersal (3m optimal) with reduced wetting sensation on pedestrians.

        The water wall and misting systems would require water to function. It would not be sustainable to use only fresh water for the system due to the increasing water scarcity and the substantial amount of energy required to pump the water. As such, rainwater harvesting could be implemented to provide the water required by the water wall and water mist systems, or at least reduce the amount of fresh water required. Harvesting and storing the rainwater higher up in the building allows for the passive movement of water by gravity, reducing the reliance on a pump. The calculation for the water required is a follow:-
        <br><br>
        Mass flow rate of 1 misting system = 6L/hour<br>
        Misting cycle = 10 min spray & 10 mins warming<br>
        Water usage = 2L/hour<br>
        Hours where cooling is required = 10 hours (9am – 7pm)<br>
        Water usage = 10L/day
        <br><br>
        2020 Annual precipitation = 1886.6mm (annual average is 2165.9mm)<br>
        Average Daily Precipitation = 1886.6/ 167 (number of rainy days) = 11.3mm or 11.3L/day/sqm
        <br><br>
        Wall Surface Area (180°) = 4067.8 sqm (residential floors)<br>
