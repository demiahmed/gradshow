    main-title="Summary"

    summary="<p style='text-align:justify'>Mars: Life from Under, is a vision for a Mars outpost that is designed as a permanent working and living settlement in anticipation of mass human migration when the irreversible effects of global warming starts has proven the Earth uninhabitable. With the many recent works and development with regard to space travel and Mar's exploration, living on Mars is not as far-fetched as it seems. Thus, in face of the growing threat of the Earth's decline, this thesis will be an design exploration for architecture that is unique to Mars, in anticipation of future Mars colonisation.
    <br><br>  
The proposed site will be in the underground lava tubes of Mars, strategically making use of physical benefit it brings. In planning for a long term healthy and thriving human settlement, the physical, psychological, and social parameters that affects quality of life will be studied. This thesis also seeks to set a definition in the design of the physical space and human movement that will be unique to Mars and its gravity. Studies of traditional earth architecture and its relationship to architecture on Mars will also be applied."

    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="<p style='text-align:justify'>Audrey is a graduate student in the Masters of Architecture course from Singapore University of Technology and Design. She believes that architecture plays a key role in shaping the way people live, function, interact and grow, and has a power to build physical relationships between poeple and nature, especially in this strongly digitalised age. While Audrey's passion for architecture lies in designing spaces that enables people to find comfort in nature, her interest in space and astronomy was the key driving factor for this thesis."

    title="Earth's decline" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>As plainly as it sounds, Earth is dying. Climate change is quickly causing our Earth to become uninhabitable given our current way of life. We are at an irreversible stage of climate change that is now a code red for humanity, Despite urgent and global calls to mitigate the effects of climate change over the past decade, this cry has clearly been ignored as the global temperature has only been climbing at an uphill and exponential rate.
    <br><br>  
    As of 2020, the global temperature increase is around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees celcius. When it reaches 2 degrees celcius, 37% of the global population will be exposed to deadly heatwaves, sea levels will generally rise by around 0.46m, severe droughts,increased rainfall and floods will be more common, biodiversity and ecosystems will be destroyed, and the coral reefs system will be almost completely non-existent.  These natural phenomena not only increase the risk of death, it also reduces the number of inhabitable areas, and if the current rate of carbon emissions and global warming doesn't change, scientists expect the Earth to reach 1.5 degrees between now till 2040, and a 2 degree increase between 2040 and 2070. 
    <br><br>  
Although fixing the Earth should be the priority given that it is the only planet that sustains life, looking at the many failed attempts of reducing global warming, the irreversible effects of climate change are also forcing humans to look towards establishing a new habitat for survival. 
    <br><br>  
Mars thus grants us a brand new start, with experience from Earth."

    title="2020's Race for Space"
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>There has been steady rate of acceleration with regards to the exploration of Mars, with many activities being carried out and planned for in the 2020s to start bringing the first humans to Mars.
    <br><br>  
 Among them include the development of SpaceX's Starship, which includes a reusable booster, as well as a large transport capacity of load and (up to 100) people into space. The reusable booster reduces the cost of each rocket launch, as well as allows for multiple space launches a day. Space travel would thus be cheaper and more efficient. The recent space orbit by Inspiration4 is also successful attempt of the first all-civilian mission to space, marking the ease and ensuing the possibility of space travel as a more common mode of transport. The 2020s would also see the beginning of crewed missions to Mars, with SpaceX planning to put the first humans on Mars in 2026. 
    <br><br>  
With space travel and Mars being more accessible, the idea of living on Mars is not as far-fetched as we think it is."

    title="Understanding Mars" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>Mars has huge temperature fluctuations, low gravity, low atmospheric pressure, lack of oxygen, lower sun intensity compared to Earth, frequent dust storms as well as highly toxic soil. These findings thus grants insights into the requirements on Mars such as how an enclosure is needed to recreate a livable atmosphere, how contact with the hazardous soil must be avoided, how sun must be maximised in the proposed design and how lower gravity could result in different structural conditions and human movements on Mars.
    <br><br>  
The proposed site for development of this thesis will be on Hellas Planitia, an impact basin that has 50% less radiation than other elevated regions, making it a more viable location for human inhabitation. 
    <br><br>  
While the site is still largely unexplored, scientists have drawn comparisons of the lava tubes on Mars to that of Earth, which grants insights into how the interior conditions on Mars could be like."

    title="Underground Lava Tubes"
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>The underground lava tubes are a natural provision of space and protection that should be used in considering a permanent habitat for the Mars outpost.The space is formed when the ceiling of the underground tube collapses to form a skylight into the tunnel.
    <br><br>  
Unlike building on land or within existing pit craters where there is minimal protection, the thick layers of ground in the underground lava tube shields the surfaces beneath from radiation, reduces temperature fluctuations, and reduces the impact caused by dust storms. Thus, this site plays a key role in ensuring a livable habitat as reduced radiation exposure would increase the lifespan of inhabitants on Mars. This natural provision of space also minimises the need for large scale excavation to create underground habitats. Aside, the breakdown debris from the collapse craters can be collected for use for construction, and the tunnel also becomes a way of access for deeper studies of the Mars geology that is crucial for Mars exploration work."

    title="Martian Gravity" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>Gravity on Mars is 3.81 m/s^2, one-third that of Earth.
    <br><br>  
     Due to the lower gravity, the energy needed to move on Mars is halved compared to that of Earth. Jumping can reach up to 90cm in height and stairs would be more comfortable if the risers were doubled in height as well. This offers the possibility for movement on Mars to include jumping from spaces to spaces, or even just climbing walls. The speed of movement on Mars is also nearly 2 times slower than on Earth. 
    <br><br>  
    While people move horizontally on Earth, the verticality of movement is  thus more evident and suitable for Martian gravity."

    title="Cross Disciplinary Lifestyle" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>As this is planned to be the first outpost of Mars where exploration and research work will be mainly carried out, the residents are likely to be those with the following job scope. With common facilities , practices, and relationship between some of these jobscopes, we can group them into 5 specific cross disciplinary clusters - Research & Exploration, Green & Food, Biology & Life, Wellness, Design & Social.
    <br><br>
    Aside from the facilities that each cluster will need, crucial to the operation of the outpost will be the life support system. This includes life-sustaining systems such as air and water harnessing systems, waste collection and renewal system, and solar cells, as well as other necessary facilities such as public spaces, storage & equipment spaces, as well as a hyper-speed transport system."

    title="Vertical Relationship" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>The lifesupport sytems being of critical importance to the entire operation, will be the main center which then connects to other areas. Looking at this same idea in a vertical context, the necessary systems would be the main core at the centre of a vertical greenhouse which also doubles as a public and recreational space. This entire central core is than connected to each of the individual clusters.
    <br><br>
This vertical system would also then support the flow of air, water and waste, to and from the greenhouse as well as the clusters."

    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>While the details are not finalised, this section just shows the idea of how I envision the printing of the main tower to be. The floors will extend out to form each level, while allowing for a continuous printing. Any interior furniture or mezzanines could be constructed using either pre fab materials or as a separate 3d print.
    <br><br>
    Prefabricated metal mesh platforms will be used in the greenhouse to reduce obstruction of light, and pockets on the 3d printed wall can be used for planting and for grip when climbing stairs."
