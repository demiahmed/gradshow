    main-title="Summary"

    summary="<p style='text-align:justify'>Inside ; Mars, is a vision for a Mars outpost that is designed as a permanent working and living settlement in anticipation of increased human migration to Mars. With the accelerating growth and development with regards to space travel and Mars exploration, it is inevitable that humans will be setting foot on Mars, and a living habitat will need to be established. Yet, there is a lack of design catered to a martian habitat that integrates the social and psychological aspects of living in Mars, especially for the establishment of a larger community and colony that will be required to live there for a minimum of 2 years. Thus, this thesis will be a design exploration for architecture unique to Mars that would allow residents to not just survive, but thrive.

    <br><br>  

The proposed site will be in the underground lava tubes of Mars, strategically making use of physical benefit it brings. In planning for a long term healthy and thriving human settlement, the physical, psychological, and social parameters that affects quality of life will be studied. This thesis also seeks to set a definition in the design that correlates to the relationship between the physical space and human movement that will be unique to Mars and its gravity. Studies of traditional earth architecture and its relationship to architecture on Mars will also be applied."

    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="<p style='text-align:justify'>Audrey is a graduate student in the Masters of Architecture course from Singapore University of Technology and Design. She believes that architecture plays a key role in shaping the way people live, function, interact and grow, and has a power to build physical relationships between poeple and nature, especially in this strongly digitalised age. While Audrey's passion for architecture lies in designing spaces that enables people to find comfort in nature, her interest in space and astronomy was the key driving factor for this thesis."

    title="2020's Race for Space"

    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>There has been steady rate of acceleration with regards to the exploration of Mars, with many activities being carried out and planned for in the 2020s to start bringing the first humans to Mars.

    <br><br>  

 Among them include the development of SpaceX's Starship, which includes a reusable booster, as well as a large transport capacity of load and (up to 100) people into space. The reusable booster reduces the cost of each rocket launch, as well as allows for multiple space launches a day. Space travel would thus be cheaper and more efficient. The recent space orbit by Inspiration4 is also a successful attempt of the first all-civilian mission to space, marking the ease and ensuing the possibility of space travel as a more common mode of transport. The 2020s would also see the beginning of crewed missions to Mars, with SpaceX planning to send the first humans on Mars in as early as 2024. 

    <br><br>  

With the increased developments with regards to Mars exploration, together with the increased accessibility of space travel, it is inevitable that there will be more humans being sent up to Mars in the upcoming decades. Due to the Earth-Mars alignment that only allows for transit between planets to happen every 2 years, it means that visitors to Mars would be required to live there within this span of time, together with what could possibly be 100 other crewmates on board the Starship."

   title="Studying Existing Approaches"

    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>While there are quite a few existing approaches and concepts being pushed for a Mars habitat, they often are focused on the shorter term goals for smaller crewed missions to Mars, and fall within the 3 main categories of either being built as bunkers in pit craters, as a new erection on land, and underground habitats.

    <br><br>  

With Mars lacking an atmosphere, the radiation received is up to 40 -50 times as that received on Earth, making it extremely dangerous for permanent habitation. While construction materials could help isolate the internal environment from the radaition, is effectiveness is only limited, and would not be suitable for long term habitation.

    <br><br>  

While the underground habitats would be effective in blocking radiation due to the natural shielding properties of the ground, many of these proposed concepts are designed with the intention of having the ground to be excavated. In considering for a habitat for hundreds of people, large scale excavation would thus be timely and energy consuming. 

    <br><br>  

Thus, there is a need  for better integration of the habitat to the natural geography of Mars to effectively make living possible for a long term residence.

    title="Understanding Mars & Hellas Planitia" 

    content="<p style='text-align:justify'> Mars has very different conditions from Earth and it alone will not be able to sustain life. Aside from the low and fluctuating temperatures, low atmospheric pressure, lack of oxygen and extremely high radiation, Mars also only has 1/3 the gravity and also a lower average sun intensity than Earth. Due to frequent dust storms and highly toxic soil, there is also a need to isolate the enclosure the external environment with smooth surfaces as much as possible to reduce stress on the corners that could possible be structural weaknesses to the enclosure.

    <br><br>  

The proposed site for development of this thesis will be on Hellas Planitia, an impact basin that has 50% less radiation than other elevated regions, making it a more viable location for human inhabitation. The radiation is further reduced within the underground lava tube (inferred to be 22.24 mSv/year as compared to Mars average radiation of 240 - 300 mSv/year), making it the most optimal site for establishment of the outpost."

    title="Underground Lava Tubes"
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>The underground lava tubes are a natural provision of space and protection that should be used in considering a permanent habitat for the Mars outpost.The space is formed when the ceiling of the underground tube collapses to form a skylight into the tunnel.

    <br><br>  

Unlike building on land or within existing pit craters where there is minimal protection, the thick layers of ground in the underground lava tube shields the surfaces beneath from radiation, reduces temperature fluctuations, and reduces the impact caused by dust storms. Thus, this site plays a key role in ensuring a livable habitat as reduced radiation exposure would increase the lifespan of inhabitants on Mars. This natural provision of space also minimises the need for large scale excavation to create underground habitats. Aside, the breakdown debris from the collapse craters can be collected for use for construction, and the tunnel also becomes a way of access for deeper studies of the Mars geology that is crucial for Mars exploration work.

    <br><br>  

While the site is still largely unexplored, scientists have drawn comparisons of the lava tubes on Mars to that of Earth, which grants insights into how the interior conditions on Mars could be like."

    title="Gravity & Site-induced Verticality" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>Gravity on Mars is 3.81 m/s², one-third that of Earth.
    <br><br>  

     While the physical requirements and necessities key for survival on Mars can be solved by technology and built in systems, the social requirements would be dependent more on the architecture and the way people move. This would then impact the circulation, the public spaces and the way people interact.
    <br><br>  

Due to the lower gravity, the energy needed to move on Mars is halved compared to that of Earth. Jumping can reach up to 90cm in height and stairs would be more comfortable if the risers were doubled in height as well. This offers the possibility for movement on Mars to include jumping from spaces to spaces, or even just climbing walls. The speed of movement on Mars is also nearly 2 times slower than on Earth. 
    <br><br>  

    While people move horizontally on Earth, the verticality of movement is  thus more evident and suitable for Martian gravity."

   title="Comparison to Traditonal Earth Typology"

    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>In studying underground habitats and verticality, we can draw comparisons to verticality in movement on Earth, which can be found largely in traditional earth architecture typologies.
    <br><br>  

   The Matmama underground houses are an example of living vertically underground. The large central courtyard acts as the main communal area before tunnels branch out into the smaller private spaces. Its strength as a social space can be seen as this courtyard was conducive for people meeting their neighbours and is where most of their days and activities are spent as well. As can be seen in the diagram, they also have nooks carved into the wall for climbing to the second storey. drawing comparisons to  human movements in a lower gravity setting.
    <br><br>  

    Similarly in the Musgum mud huts, verticality of movement is reinforced through the use of textured facades. The textures on the wall was mainly for maintenance - people could move vertically on the building to access the top opening, and specific forms also allows for the drainage of rain."

1. How people survive on Mars (life support); 
    <br><br>
2. How people interact on Mars (social); and 
    <br><br>
3. How people move on Mars (mobility).

    title="How People Survive: Structure & Life Support Systems" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>The central spine acts as the greenhouse where planters will be integrated in the printing of the wall through the use of textured facades. Steel frames run throughout from the centre to the circumference, contributing structurally to hold the trampoline and metal mesh platforms, while at the same time housing pipes and cables for the transport of air, water, oxygen, power, and waste throughout the outpost.
    <br><br>
Electricity is harnessed from solar cells in the roof to power the systems, generators, and especially interior lights that is critical for daily activities as well as plant growth.
    <br><br>
Water and oxygen can be generated from the electrolysis of martian brine, which can be found seasonally in the martian ground. Rovers would collect and transport the brine to the outpost for deposition, which would then be processed into hydrogen and oxygen. While the oxygen can be transported circulated immediately within the outpost, water can only be produced after the combination of both hydogen and oxygen. The water will be stored in a storage tank at the base, and pumped up along the pipes when required for watering the greenhouse planters or daily consumption
    <br><br>
Waste from the living clusters will also be processed and recirculated to the greenhouse planters as fertilisers."

    title="How People Move: Recreation in Circulation " 

    content="<p style='text-align:justify'With relationship to verticality in movement, 3 modes of circulation have been extablished:
    <br><br>
1. Trampoline core; 
    <br><br>
2. Circumferential wall climbing; 
    <br><br>
3. Hyperloop system.
    <br><br>
The trampoline core is envisioned as the main mode of transportation situated at the center of the outpost, connecting the bottom to the top.  It is an integration of recreation and fitness in circulation, which makes movement and the time spent while moving less stagnant. Not only does this make moving more fun which would boost the mood and mental well being of the residents, the trampoline also allows them to stay active while moving. This is critical to ensure that residents are maintaining their muscle mass in a low gravity environment, which could otherwise result in an unhealthy physique. Aside, the lower gravity also means that objects will feel lighter - this applies to both people and carried objects -  thus lessening the load while moving.
    <br><br>
Wall climbing is done with the use of textured wall facades and are designed to cater for lower rates of movements for work or meditaiton. Planter pockets will be integrated with the printing of the wall. While holding the plants, these protruded pockets will doubles up as a climbing nook that allows for residents to step on and grip, similarly to rock climbing. Platforms are also spotted along the walls as a breakout space which can be used for work or meditation. Their varying spans give the flexibility of choice for either group or individual activities.
    <br><br>
Lastly, the hyperloop system is a high speed transportation system that directly connects clusters to clusters. They are housed within the 3d printed organic structure, and are targetted mainly for those who need immediate transport between clusters, for ease of mobility for injured residents, as well as heavy load transfer across the outpost. It is also the only mode of access to the skywalk that is situated at the very top of the outpost."

    title="Construction Process" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'>To kickstart the construction process, the following equipment would need to be deployed on Mars; an inflatable filament mixer, a solar powered donre, and an excavation rover. The solar powered drone would be accompanied with detachable components, namely a 3d scanner, an excavation bowl, a claw carrier, and a printing nozzle.
    <br><br>
1: Filament mixers are carried into the caves via drones and inflated. 
    <br><br>
2. Excavator rovers break down the existing debris and are transported into the filament mixer.
    <br><br>
3. When the area under the skylight is cleared, a 3d scan of the existing tunnel condition will be done to formulate the optimal base point for printing.
    <br><br>
4. These points will be sent to the rovers, which will drill into the ground for the foundation of the outpost to be established. A base layer of 3d printing will be required to complete the foundation set up before printing of the outpost can commence.
    <br><br>
5. Once printing is ready, part of the drones will switch to the printer attachment. Martian rock filament and PETG filament can be printed concurrently together with the installation of the prefab materials where necessary.
    <br><br>
5. To allow for continuous printing, drones would replace each other whenever a filament top-up is required.
    <br><br>
6. Once construction is completed, the rovers and drones can be used for other exploration work on Mars, where as the filament tank can be transported for the priting of future outposts.
