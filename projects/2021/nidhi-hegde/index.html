                 summary=" seadogs speculates the generation of a new ecology, born from the heart of the fishermen 

     <br /><br /> 
	 
	 
The thesis explores the future of coastal fishing communities in Peru in the year 2100, as climate change and other extractive industries intensify. 

The proposal focuses on the problem of food insecurity for fishing dependant countries and explores the way of living that will emerge.

    title="Understanding the territory" 
    text="Peruvian waters contain some of the most highly productive ecosystems in the world, due largely to the effects of the Humboldt Current, an eastern boundary current that flows North along the coast of South America. Combined with the geography of the Peruvian coast, this current pushes cold, nutrient-rich water towards the surface by a process known as upwelling, creating ideal conditions for seaweed and plankton and hence food for the animal ecosystems.
     <br /><br /> 

	Northern Peru is the region of the country hit hardest by anthropogenic effects. The weather effects of El Nino are most significant here due to the geographic exposure of this area, causing flooding and landslides. 
	
	   <br /><br /> 
	It is also here that another extractive industry operates. Oceanic oil extraction is almost exclusively done in the Northern areas of Peru, by the state-owned Petroperu but also infrastructure built by China, South Korea, Columbia, and the United Kingdom. The offshore oil rigs are known to leak periodically, but the extent to which this occurs is unknown as companies are expected to self-report spills, with Peruvian fishermen documenting oil spills far more extensive than those reported by corporations in the area. These oil spills are incredibly damaging to the ecosystem, blocking sunlight from reaching vegetation, affecting fish growth, and poisoning what marine life manages to survive.

    text=" Following an el nino triggered oil spill in 2040, the government put in place measures to contain it using oil booms and bioremediation with algae. 

A by-product of bioremediation, these beautiful green forests formed in the sea. Harmful algae blooms manifest when algae starts to grow uncontrollably forming a layer on the ocean surface, blocking sunlight. 

     <br /><br /> 




Fisherman communities see the algae bloom as an opportunity to start harvesting the algae to create biofuel.

What was initially the side effect of the catastrophe, becomes an incredible bio product. This is the stepping stone to a whole new ecology and productive tissue"

What if landscapes could be transient? 


  <br /><br /> 
  
How would they inform a different way of inhabitation, one with movement of constant flow 

These flexible landscapes, allow us to generate a new productive tissue in the seaâ€” "

Synthetic fish becomes a new alternative food source, providing fishermen with jobs and a new industry. It is powered by biofuel, a source of clean renewable energy. 

It is plant based, and non extractive in nature, growing as a scaffolding on the rig.

    title="Inhabitation : Modular structural frames"
    text="Inhabitation is redefined in the sea, a structural frame is designed for people to build their own houses inside them. It provides a structure for an informal and communal way of living. 

The frames are modular and stack on one another, with a maximum of five floors. Each frame has a diameter of 50m with an outer decking. 


	
	  <br /><br /> 
	  
The funnel at the top collects rainwater for drinking, which then fills up the tank underwater.This weight distribution ,allows the inhabitation module to be buoyant. 

  <br /><br /> 

The frames function as bioreactor pipes for more algae production. This is used in the base module for wastewater cleansing. Side funnels are also introduced to catch rainwater, which is for personal use and consumption.

    title="Inhabitation : Occupancy rules"
    text="Although people build their own houses, rules of space occupancy in the frames are imposed to ensure circulation and light penetration. 
	
	  <br /><br /> 
	  
The frames are first subdivided and beams and columns are placed every 10m. The columns act as a basis for houses to attach. 
The first level centre fills up, leaving corridors every 4 subdivisions. Followed by level 2.Current houses then extend with smaller ones also slotting in. 


  <br /><br /> 

Only when the first 2 levels centres are built, does the perimeter develop, it is initially left as an extension of the outside space. They develop in alternates, for light porosity. 
  <br /><br /> 

The third floor builds when the first 2 are filled, starting with the centre.

    text=" For the seaweed and agriculture system,  

Branching is explored, 
Different angles and lengths are tested for productivity. 
 
 


     <br /><br /> 

The system grows with a seed module attached to the housing. It consists of a productive pier and a processing core. The optimum angle for production is 30 deg.  Every 80m, the direction of the branching is re-assessed based on site. The seaweed is a flexible system that grows in between the booms. 

Agriculture is introduced as more people move in, and the branches get wider at 60 deg, in order to allow space for the modules to slot in between.
