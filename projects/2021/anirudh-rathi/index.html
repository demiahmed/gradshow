    <project-bio main-title="Discourse"
                 summary="In its infancy during the 80s & 90s, city- states like Singapore & Hongkong built Transit Oriented Developments (TODs) by capitalizing on the revenue generated from the sale of greenfield land in immediate proximity of the upcoming  mass rapid transit stations. Fast Forward to 2020, dense urban centers have little greenfield land & typically consist of pockets of space which aspire efficient utilization. These erstwhile developments lag behind in advancements of urban codes & dynamic societal aspirations. Transportation infrastructure has progressed to more complicated typologies, far beyond what TODs have kept pace with.
    <br><br>
    A portmanteau of brownfield sites and urban infill development activated by soft mobility -  mobi-brownfill represents the opportunity to rejuvenating dense fabrics by measuring soft mobility indices. This thesis posits to revitalize obsolete places and spaces to reinforce the community by capturing maximum accessibility potential. This is done by redensification  as a means of renewal."
    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme=" As a graduate architecture student, I have been interested at the application of technology in the urban design discourse and devising interventions which serve the community. Cities and communities are banks of big data created due to human activities and are hence, ripe for disruption via data-driven decisions.
     <br><br>
     I like to believe that technology has a colossal role to play in meeting our societal needs as we chart our journey towards a sustainable future."

    <text-image title="Selected Site"
                text="The site selected eventually is located in Marine Parade. The site represents a high density of brrownfill sites, a strong disconnect from the neighbouring East Coast Park as the vicinity is disected by the East Coast Parkway. There is also an upcoming mass rapid transit station in the neighbourhood, hence representing the complete combo of desirable factors for enhancement. The site also fares well on the urban syntax previously conducted, coming in at 23 out of 391 sites."

The proposed axis consists of a total approach, taking into account soft mobility measures including cycling, walking, personal mobility devices which foster an active living.  "></image-text>
