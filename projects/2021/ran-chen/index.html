    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Habitat loss due to human expansion is the primary threat for species extinction. Biodiversity loss can put a huge strain on the ecosystem and its collapse can trigger irreversible implications to the entire planet.
    <br><br>  
    My thesis hopes to recognize the importance of urban biodiversity as ecosystem services and hopes for a shift in perspective from anthropocentric to eco-centric. It aims to investigate ways to extend the existing ecosystem network in the built environment on the city scale. The prototype of the stepping stone typology is located in the east of Singapore extending from the existing four nature reserves, strengthening the existing ecological network by enhancing three-dimensional ecological connectivity. 
	<br><br>
	The prototype should primarily provide vertical habitats for airborne species mainly bird species but also incorporate educational programmes as well as research spaces which overall encourages cohabitation on the vertical scale."

    aboutme="Hi, I’m Ran, and I’m an upcoming Master of Architecture Graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design. I enjoy the process of designing and problem solving. I believe that architects hold the power but also carry the responsibility to design the places for the better, for both human and non-human occupants. Apart from architecture, I also love spending time in nature due to its healing and restorative properties."

    title="01 Introduction" 
    text="The world is ever more global, leading to the environmental footprints to be spread even farther. The expansion of urban areas has led to a growth in urban population and consumption, which come at the expense of environmental degradation. Habitat loss driven primarily by human expansion is the biggest threat facing by most animal species."

    title="02 Importance of Ecosystem Services"
    text="Enhancing biodiversity in cities has now been widely recognized as a concept of improving the sustainability of urban functioning and making the urban environment more resilient to disturbances through the provision of ecosystem services. 
	<br><br>
	The benefits of these services are diverse, but usually classified into four main categories: provisioning, regulating, social-cultural and supporting ecosystem services."

	<text-only title="03 Urban Scale Approach" content=" In order to better support Singapore’s native biodiversity on the national scale, a system of network needs to be put in place. Thus, the idea of ecological network comes in. An ecological network consists of core areas, connected by corridors to facilitate wildlife movement and stepping stones that further strengthen the network. 
	<br><br>
	In Singapore's context, the backbone of the system has already been implemented. The ecological network is made up of four nature reserves as main core areas, followed by over 20 satellite core areas called nature areas. These areas are then connected by various corridors and parks connectors to act as ecological links, facilitating movements of birds and other animals.
	<br><br>
	To make up for the lack of large nature areas and broken corridors in the east of Singapore, stepping stone typology is to be introduced to make the ecological network more comprehensive and more responsive on the microscale. Each stepping stone is a small tract of habitat between core areas, and does not take up much footprint." "> </text-only>

    text="Birds are mobile and airborne, and therefore, will benefit the most from this typology as they do not require continuity on the ground. Besides, birds also play crucial roles in the urban environment; they help with pollination, insect control as well as disbursing seeds which in return contribute to the reforestation; they also act as one of the most important ecological indicators of the state of the environment that we live in as they are sensitive to habitual changes in our ecosystem."

    text="The bird tower hopes to draw parallel form a typical canopy tree which its crown spreads from the main tree trunk and birds reside in various zones at different heights. The spaces for people are located towards the central core whereas the outer space is reserved for birds to forage and inhabit. 
	<br><br>
	Visitors are to come in from the visitor center located on the ground floor, either takes the staircase or lift up to viewing platforms at various heights and finally to the rooftop garden where 360 ° panorama view is available. They are also partially allowed into the research space & nursery. The staff member should have full access to both the nursery and nesting area. Nesting area and foraging area provide food sources for the birds and are located away from the viewing platforms. Greens acts as a soft facade to camouflage the visitors from the birds."

	<text-only title="06 Site" content="The test site is chosen to be on a empty plot of land in Serangoon district with existing and future green corrdiors both in the North and South of the site (within 1.5km radius based on urban scale approach). Zooming in, the area is located much away from the main traffic junction, and with low-rise settlements as a main building typology in the close proximity. This ensures that bird tower is visible from afar without little obstruction. The absence of noise and high-rise, as well as the presence of continuous road-side greenery allow this plot of land to be an ideal location for the bird tower prototype. "> </text-only>

	<text-only title="07 Buiding Components" content="The bird tower is made up of three main building components. 
<br><br>
First is the concrete central core which is made up of a lift and open staircase which provides options for visitors for efficient vertical movement. The concrete core also provides structural support, allowing viewing platforms and nursery spaces at various heights to extend out from it.
<br><br>
The exoskeleton consists of a series of much thicker horizontal rings and thinner diagrid timber structure connecting these horizontal ring structure for various shrubs and climbers to grow. 
<br><br>
The space in between the exoskeleton and the central core is branch-like “infill” to mimic similar environments for birds to inhabit."> </text-only>
