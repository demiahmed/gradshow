    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Habitat loss due to human expansion is the primary threat for species extinction. Biodiversity loss can put a huge strain on the ecosystem and its collapse can trigger irreversible implications to the entire planet.
    <br><br>  
    My thesis hopes to recognize the importance of urban biodiversity as ecosystem services and hopes for a shift in perspective from anthropocentric to eco-centric. It aims to investigate ways to extend the existing ecosystem network in the built environment on the city scale. The prototype of the stepping stone typology is located in the east of Singapore extending from the existing four nature reserves, strengthening the existing ecological network by enhancing three-dimensional ecological connectivity. 
	<br><br>
	The prototype should primarily provide vertical habitats for airborne species mainly bird species but also incorporate other programmes such as basic services and amenities as well as research and educational programmes for visitors which overall encourages cohabitation on the vertical scale."

    aboutme="Hi, I’m Ran, and I’m an upcoming Master of Architecture Graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design. I enjoy the process of designing and problem solving. I believe that architects hold the power but also carry the responsibility to design the places for the better, for both human and non-human occupants. Apart from architecture, I also love spending time in nature due to its healing and restorative properties."

    title="01 Introduction" 
    text="The world is ever more global, leading to the environmental footprints to be spread even farther. The expansion of urban areas has led to a growth in urban population and consumption, which come at the expense of environmental degradation. Habitat loss driven primarily by human expansion is the biggest threat facing by most animal species."

    title="02 Importance of Ecosystem Services"
    text="Enhancing biodiversity in cities has now been widely recognized as a concept of improving the sustainability of urban functioning and making the urban environment more resilient to disturbances through the provision of ecosystem services. 
	<br><br>
	The benefits of these services are diverse, but usually classified into four main categories: provisioning, regulating, social-cultural and supporting ecosystem services."

    title="03 Urban Scale Approach" 
    text="An ecological network consists of core areas, connected by corridors to facilitate wildlife movement and stepping stones that further strengthen the network. 
	<br><br>
	In Singapore's context, the backbone of the system has already been implemented. The ecological network is made up of four nature reserves as main core areas, followed by over 20 satellite core areas called nature areas. These areas are then connected by various corridors and parks connectors to act as ecological links, facilitating movements of birds and other animals.
	<br><br>
	To make up for the lack of large nature areas and broken corridors in the east of Singapore, stepping stone typology is to be introduced to make the ecological network more comprehensive and more responsive on the microscale. Each stepping stone is a small tract of habitat between core areas, and does not take up much footprint."

    text="Besides the fact that birds will benefit the most from this typology as they do not require continuity on the ground, birds also play crucial roles in the urban environment; they help with pollination, insect control as well as disbursing seeds which in return contribute to the reforestation; they also act as one of the most important ecological indicators of the state of the environment that we live in as they are sensitive to habitual changes in our ecosystem."
