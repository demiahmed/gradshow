    <title-text title="Optimised Emergency Shelter Design for Post-Disaster"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Millions of people are displaced from their homes each year due to natural disasters. Despite these numbers, responses to disaster tend to be reactionary and display a lack of skilled personnel with experience in managing disaster responses.
    <br><br>  
    The thesis will explore the design of a deployable emergency shelter that: utilises low quality, heterogenous salvaged materials from post-disaster contexts to create structurally performant forms through the use of high-tech optimisation techniques, combined with low-tech construction skills, with the added purpose of upskilling locals."

    aboutme="I'm Kee Ting, an architecture student. I believe that good design stems from an understanding of the human condition and should be a smart response to the environment. I hope to contribute to the architectural scene with my interests in digital computation and social patterns.<br>"

    title="Each Disaster is Different."
    text="The needs of each disaster response varies based on a variety of factors, including the nature of disaster, type of land provided, availability of local materials and skills and the receptiveness of local culture. As such, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, due to the lack of skilled personnel involved in disaster management, 'catalogue' solutions are provided to victims.
    <br><br>
    Especially due to climate change, the intensity of typhoons have been increasing. As such, planning norms for typhoon-resilient shelters must increase in standard accordingly. This project will seek to find a solution that allows good shelters with structurally performant forms to be built even with low quality salvaged materials and the use of low-tech construction skills."

    <br><br>This thesis focuses on design for semi-permanent shelters beyond the initial few weeks post disaster. The shelter is designed to last beyond 2 years, with the consideration that many disaster victims typically are not able to relocate within 2 years and still rely on the shelter for basic needs."></img-caption>

    title="Material: Coconut Lumber"
    text="It was estimated that 33 million coconut trees were destroyed during Haiyan, severely impacting livelihoods, but providing an abundance of local building material. Hence, the ambition is to introduce higher-tech utilisation of these materials, using structural simulation tools and optimisation techniques."

    <img-caption content="As coconut lumber processing is a very labourious process, sawing is removed from the labour process. The streamlining of the process expedites the construction process significantly, ensuring disaster victims can be rehomed as soon as possible. In using roundwood trusses, the project takes inspiration by the Tree Fork Truss by Architectural Association."></img-caption>

    <img-caption content="Many shelters built post Typhoon Haiyan were built with metal strap connection joints. Here, I replace the joints with the bolt and nut - allowing for moment flexibility along the axes of the trusses, thereby releasing stresses at the connections."></img-caption>

    title="Generative Algorithm and Optimisation"
    text="Initially, the project explored agent-based modelling and genetic-based generative algorithms to generate the shape of the structure. However, instead of attempting to fit lumber into the 'ideal' shapes of trusses, I felt that in the post-disaster context, it gave so much more meaning to generate a form <i>based on the salvaged materials</i> instead.
    <br><br>Hence, the generative algorithm tries to optimise the arrangement of existing materials. To do so, it generates countless possible ways to assemble a structure, given the materials. It then picks the best-performing structure in terms of least deformation and optimises it further by removing under-utilised elements."
