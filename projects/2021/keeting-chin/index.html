    <title-text title="Optimised Emergency Shelter Design for Post-Disaster"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Millions of people are displaced from their homes each year due to natural disasters. Despite these numbers, responses to disaster tend to be reactionary and display a lack of skilled personnel with experience in managing disaster responses.
    <br><br>  
    The thesis will explore the design of a deployable emergency shelter that: utilises low quality, heterogenous salvaged materials from post-disaster contexts to create structurally performant forms through the use of optimisation techniques, and low-tech construction skills, with the purpose of upskilling." 
    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="I'm Kee Ting, an architecture student. I believe that good design stems from an understanding of the human condition and should be a smart response to the environment. I hope to contribute to the architectural scene with my interests in digital computation and social patterns.<br>"

    title="Each Disaster is Different."
    text="The needs of each disaster response varies based on a variety of factors, including the nature of disaster, type of land provided, availability of local materials and skills and the receptiveness of local culture. As such, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, due to the lack of skilled personnel involved in disaster management, 'catalogue' solutions are provided to victims. This project will seek to find a solution that allows good shelters with structurally performant forms to be built even with low quality salvaged materials and the use of low-tech construction skills."

    title="Long-term Shelter" 
    text="The design is for shelters beyond the initial few weeks post disaster. A team will set up base on site to teach the locals to gather materials and disseminate information on how to build in the form of pamphlets and an app."

    title="Coconut Lumber, Optimised"
    text="It was estimated that 33 million coconut trees were destroyed during Haiyan, severely impacting livelihoods, but providing an abundance of local building material. Hence, the ambition is to introduce higher-tech utilisation of these materials, using structural simulation tools and optimisation techniques."
