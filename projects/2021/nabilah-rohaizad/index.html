    main-title="Summary"
	summary="Singapore’s high-density creates the need for intra-town connectivity, with most people turning to cycling as an alternative transport mode for short-distance travels. However, the unprecedented influx of delivery cyclists, and the post-pandemic boost in cycling numbers, have further aggravated tensions between cyclists, pedestrians and other road users.
	<br><br>  
    The revitalization of this scene enacts a strong response that can adapt to the ever-changing conditions. As such, this thesis seeks a dynamic approach in reimagining Singapore’s cycling infrastructure within neighborhoods, targeting
	the needs of delivery, recreation and casual cyclists on a neighborhood scale. This will be performed
	through object detection, observational studies and a participatory design process
	respectively. The final outcome will be conceptualized as a design handbook that
	presents a new framework for the design of cycling infrastructure."
	
	student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="Growing up in Singapore, we are on always on the look out for new places; secret spots to escape reality, weekend markets, hipster cafes and everything in between.
	My question was always this: How do we contribute to the placemaking efforts of a place, when we are constantly on the move and chasing the next big thing?
    <br><br>
	I believe that the power of architecture lies in its ability as a social condenser - for disconnected communities to come together,
	for strangers to want to start a conversation with one another, and for the long-standing communities to be able to sustain itself in a city where change is the only constant.

	<text-only title="SITE CONTEXT" content="Yishun is one of the first five towns under the National Cycling Plan to have off-road cycling networks. It has laid its groundwork but ultimately requiring a serious response to cope with the sharp increase in cycling numbers.
	The particular intervention site is GV Yishun. GV Yishun is a cineplex building, containing 10 movie halls.
	It was first opened in 1991, but over time, the crowd gradually phased and even after its renovation in 2010, it remained largely underutilized, with multiple areas along the perimeter turning into hang out areas.
	<br><br>
	The low activation of these building spaces, coupled with the high cycling activity at this crossroad, makes GV Yishun a prime location for design interventions."> </text-only>
	
	<single-image url="./data/design method.jpg"></single-image>
	
	<text-only title="ANALYSIS: OBJECT DETECTION" content="The baseline of cycling infrastructure falls under the URA Walking and Cycling Guide.
	A qualitative online survey was distributed in the thesis preparation stage of this proposal.
	80 unique respondents gave many valuable insights on what they thought of existing infrastructure.
	Survey results can be found below.
	<br><br><b><u>
	https://tinyurl.com/thesisprep-rawsurveyresults</b></u>
	<br><br>
	To summarize, a large majority felt that existing cycling infrastructure has fallen short in one way or another, through disruptions (caused by ongoing maintenance works) and misuse of these infrastructure.
	Following up on this finding, object detection was a suitable way to further investigate and capture evidence for the invisible micro tensions that contribute to inefficient usage of cycling infrastructure.
	<br><br>
	To tie this topic back to our site, a 400m intervention radius (around GV Yishun) is organized into routes that replicate the point-to-point cycling trips of delivery cyclists.
	The collected video data from these simulated cycling routes, then act as an input into a pre-trained model that was able to sieve out scenarios based on spatial overlaps within the video frames.
	The resultant outputs are 5s snippets that the model has identified as ‘conflict’ scenarios. Diving deeper, these scenarios can point two either inefficient infrastructure or a lack of infrastructure at different junctures along the routes.
	The infrastructural problems depicted in the scenarios are then condensed into 3 concepts for the typology design - demonstrating power, coping with fear and self-portrayal."> </text-only>

	<text-only title="ANALYSIS: OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES" content="Through observation studies we will be able to identify design opportunities in the grey spaces. After 2 days of pilot studies, I was able to get a good estimate on time interval and know which methods from the Space Syntax Observation Manual, can be applied.
	In the snapshot method, I identified two main areas to observe. The first one being this space.
	Within the central space, people generally stand around waiting for their friends, are looking at the movie trailers or are generally passing by without noticing their surroundings. 
	<br><br>
	The second one is the external perimeter that is facing Northpoint. This location is robust and are where most of the activities occur. 
	Three consistent habits that I have identified are people sitting along the edge of the wall, the parking of bicycles along walkways and again, a lot of standing around at different areas. It can be classified as an ‘idle space’ before one enters or leaves the buildings and since it is mainly dominated by the cycling crowd, there is an opportunity to design for their ‘touch and go’ activities.
	From this analysis, the next step would be to design for modular set pieces that can be placed along these routes to capture the flow of traffic back into the activity areas."> </text-only>

	<text-only title="ANALYSIS: PARTICIPATION TOOL" content="The strength of participatory design at the building scale is to better anticipate the needs of the community, in order to create a physical platform for the cycling community in the immediate area to come together.
	We have adopted this open-source chatbot that is able to give media prompts as well as provide multiple logics – if person chooses option A, it will lead to a different series of questions from if he chose option B. This chatbot would then be deployed on site, sparking conversations.
	<br><br>
	And the current outlook is promising as people have opinions on what they would like to see for the cycling community there. There are two main outcomes of this tool, the first being the program that they wish to see in the public space.
	The second outcome would be on the type of massing strategy that the participants are most aligned with. This would be either having a main atrium as opposed to more segmented areas, having an outdoor vs an indoor space etc.
	In this way, the iterations are ‘ground up’, creating avenues for interaction and community building."> </text-only>

	To bolster the existing local initiatives in promoting cycling in Singapore, this underground playscape was conceptualized.
	Ease of access by the ramping surfaces from the ground plane, creates a large gesture of continuity and invitation into this bicycle park.
	Aside from ancillary facilities of changing room and common benches, the shared equipment room encourages enthusiasts to take ownership of their space.
