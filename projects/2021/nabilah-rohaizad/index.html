    main-title="Summary"
	summary="Singapore’s high-density creates the need for intra-town connectivity, with most people turning to cycling as an alternative transport mode for short-distance travels. However, the unprecedented influx of delivery cyclists, and the post-pandemic boost in cycling numbers, have further aggravated tensions between cyclists, pedestrians and other road users.
	<br><br>  
    The revitalization of this scene enacts a strong response that can adapt to the ever-changing conditions. As such, this thesis seeks a dynamic approach in reimagining Singapore’s cycling infrastructure within neighborhoods, targeting
	the needs of delivery, recreation and casual cyclists on a neighborhood scale. This will be performed
	through object detection, observational studies and a participatory design process
	respectively. The final outcome will be conceptualized as a design handbook that
	presents a new framework for the design of cycling infrastructure."
	
	student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="Growing up in Singapore, we are on always on the look out for new places; secret spots to escape reality, weekend markets, hipster cafes and everything in between.
	My question was always this: How do we contribute to the placemaking efforts of a place, when we are constantly on the move and chasing the next big thing?
    <br><br>
	This is where architecture comes into play. I believe that the power of architecture lies in its ability as a social condenser - for disconnected communities to come together,
	for strangers to want to start a conversation with one another, and for the long-standing communities to be able to sustain itself in a city where change is the only constant.
	It does get overwhelming at times to think of this in its entirety. But as the world moves, I want to learn to move with it and satisfy my curiosities on how to create a better tomorrow.

    title="Current State"
	text="Singapore has been promised over 1300km of cycling paths by 2030. Over the years, there has been a continuous expansion of cycling networks and a relentless push for cycling towns. This then draws the question – is there quality over quantity? Back in the 1940s, bicycles were the primary mode of transport, with a peak in the 1960s before it got phased out.
	It was not until the late 1990s that certain concessions were made. When cycling re-entered the scene in the 2000s, there was a lot of catching up to do in terms of infrastructure. The first wave was in 2007 when Tampines GRC pushed for legalization of bicycles on footpaths. Ever since then, there has been conscious effort to design cycling towns.
	<br><br>
	The slow transition into cycling towns was then completely disrupted by COVID, leaving much to be desired."

    title="Site Context" 
    text="Yishun is one of the first five towns under the National Cycling Plan to have off-road cycling networks. It has laid its groundwork but ultimately requiring a serious response to cope with the sharp increase in cycling numbers.
	<br><br>
	The particular intervention site is GV Yishun. GV Yishun is a cineplex building, containing 10 movie halls.
	It was first opened in 1991, but over time, the crowd gradually phased and even after its renovation in 2010, it remained largely underutilized, with multiple areas along the perimeter turning into hang out areas.
	<br><br>
	The low activation of these building spaces, coupled with the high cycling activity at this crossroad, makes GV Yishun a prime location for design interventions.

    title="Urban Design (Object Detection)"
	text="There is an existing baseline for infrastructure design that falls under the URA Walking and Cycling Guide.
	However, as reflected in my prior surveys, much of the existing cycling infrastructure has gone through disruptions due to other works and even misuse by its users.
	There exists a need to capture evidence for invisible micro tensions that contribute to its inefficiency.
	<br><br>
	A 400m intervention radius is organized into routes that replicate the point-to-point cycling trips of delivery cyclists.
	This video data then acted as an input into a pre-trained model that was able to sieve out scenarios based on spatial overlaps within the video frames.
	The output are these 5s snippets that the model has identified as ‘conflict’ scenarios. Diving deeper, these scenarios can point two either inefficient infrastructure or a lack of infrastructure at different junctures along the routes.
	The infrastructural problems depicted in the scenarios are then condensed into 3 concepts for the typology design - demonstrating power, coping with fear and self-portrayal."

    title="Tactical Design (Observational Studies)" 
    text="Through observation studies we will be able to identify design opportunities in the grey spaces. After 2 days of pilot studies, I was able to get a good estimate on time interval and know which methods from the Space Syntax Observation Manual, can be applied.
	<br><br>
	In the snapshot method, I identified two main areas to observe. The first one being this space.
	Within the central space, people generally stand around waiting for their friends, are looking at the movie trailers or are generally passing by without noticing their surroundings. 
	<br><br>
	The second one is the external perimeter that is facing Northpoint. This location is robust and are where most of the activities occur. 
	Three consistent habits that I have identified are people sitting along the edge of the wall, the parking of bicycles along walkways and again, a lot of standing around at different areas. It can be classified as an ‘idle space’ before one enters or leaves the buildings and since it is mainly dominated by the cycling crowd, there is an opportunity to design for their ‘touch and go’ activities.
	From this analysis, the next step would be to design for modular set pieces that can be placed along these routes to capture the flow of traffic back into the activity areas.

    title="Building Design (Participatory Design)"
	text="The strength of participatory design at the building scale is to better anticipate the needs of the community, in order to create a physical platform for the cycling community in the immediate area to come together.
	We have adopted this open-source chatbot that is able to give media prompts as well as provide multiple logics – if person chooses option A, it will lead to a different series of questions from if he chose option B. This chatbot would then be deployed on site, sparking conversations.
	<br><br>
	And the current outlook is promising as people have opinions on what they would like to see for the cycling community there. There are two main outcomes of this tool, the first being the program that they wish to see in the public space.
	The second outcome would be on the type of massing strategy that the participants are most aligned with. This would be either having a main atrium as opposed to more segmented areas, having an outdoor vs an indoor space etc.
	<br><br>
	In this way, the iterations are ‘ground up’, creating avenues for interaction and community building."
