    main-title="Summary"
    summary="It is noticeable that more than 80% of Singaporeans live in the public housing that is built and planned by the Housing and Development board (HDB). The design of a good quality housing is therefore always a challenging task particularly in Singapore, given that it is land and resource constrained and be it one of the highly dense and urbanized countries in the world. Furthermore, due to its fixed unit layout, can the public housing accommodate to the demographic changes over its lifetime?

    <br><br>  
    This thesis aims to research on ways to extend the lifespan of the housing in the past era, by involving broad participation at different levels, and inviting continuous transformation over time, through studying on the living patterns of the individual households, to accommodate demographic and demand changes. It envisions to regenerate a new housing paradigm from the existing structural system through adopting adaptable and flexible infill system of the building. In addition, to challenge the homogeneity of housing, and re-empower the dwellers in co-creating their dwellings, the  process of design would engage the future users and residents, thereby creating a livable and resilient environment for the community even in a high-density context."

    aboutme="Hui Sin is a Master's Student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), pursuing her Masters of Architecture. She always believes that an inspiring design can affect oneâ€™s life. Nature itself is already a perfect system for people to live in, while bringing in the architecture to help the people to live better; she is constantly exploring on ways to allow architecture to communicate with the nature, making it a plus on top of the nature system.

    title="69 Moulmein Road"
    text="Block 69 Moulmein Road is interestingly placed at the intersection of Moulmein Road and the Central Expressway (CTE) exit 7A. It is uncommon since it stands alone among a private housing neighborhood, where the nearest clusters of public housing is across the CTE at Rangoon and Cambridge Road.. 
	<br><br>
	In the past, where the CTE presently runs was previously an estate of low-rise Singapore Improvement Trust flats. In fact, block 69 Moulmein Road was the first of a new typology of conventional point blocks built by the HDB in the early 1970s. 
	<br><br>
	Block 69 Moulmein Road is constructed in 1972 and open to the public on 7 January 1972. It received 700 entries to purchase 76 unites of 4-room flats where the demand was considered quite high during that period.
	When the apartments in Whampoa estate were planned to be upgraded in 1999, block 69 Moulmein Road were reportedly left out of the scheme until dwellers requested the government and HDB to be included. 
	<br><br>
	Studies shown below is to understand the site better. This thesis will reuse the exisitng building system and regenerate a new housing paradigm to serve the 1970s housing society. Furthermore, wind and daylight studies are also taken into account to improve the living condition and quality of the residents."

    title="Communal Rooms" 
    text="This sustainable living lab has configured 6 extra units as common rooms to conceptualise shared spaces based on common interests and needs. Based on the residents' feedback, 6 communal rooms with different functions are proposed, such as the study room, communal kitchen and dining, multipurpose room, open office, gym room and recreational room. This way of living addresses the loss of real and physical social networks in modern urban living, and restores a sense of collective belonging that is lacking in the contemporary city."

	<text-only title="Home Identity" content="After readjusting the unit sizes according to the individual needs, they can choose to customize their own unit layout, going beyond the conventional limitation of interior design alone, including choosing different facade openings for different rooms, so as to minimize the consumption of energy. 
	This improved living lab allows the individual resident to flexibly adapt programs and layouts overtime. This means that it will be future proof and thus reduces renovation costs and wasted building materials on the long term. On the short term, it envisions to maximize the occupancy level of the building.

    title="Multiplicity" 
    text="The proposed floorplan is able to fit more types of households as compared to the existing floorplan, ranging from the XS size to the XL size, thus able to achieve its multiplicity feature to accommodate a wide range of demographic. The residents are able to choose from having the semi-private corridor with the private balcony scheme to encourage more interactions with the adjacent neighbours, while some could choose to privatise the corridor as their own living space to maintain certain level of privacy.
	<br><br> 
	With the goal of moving towards a carbon neutral community, by taking the advantage of the good natural ventilation condition around the site, wind simulations have been conducted through ANSYS FLUENT to study the indoor ventilation quality of the proposed individual's customized units. Most of the units are able to achieve a well air circulation quality through cross ventilation, thus this would eventually result in a lower consumption of electricity.
	<br><br>
	Furthermore, the households who stay in duplex loft unit could experience better ventilation through stack effect whereby the hot air rises towards the window openings at the upper floor and eventually would cool down the living space below. 
	The annual  daylight simulation conducted for individual household is to study the daylit area of the individual unit with different type of window openings that has been chosen by the residents. The studies show that most of the units at the corner plots have achieved at least 50% daylit area, this would means that the rooms are relatively comfortable to stay around without any artificial lighting during the daytime when the sky is clear.
	At the community loop whereby the private balconies and outdoor decks are mostly used for growing plants and flowers. Hence illuminance study will help to determine whether these outdoor areas are exposed to sufficient daylight for plant growing. Simulation results show that at different time of the day, different outdoor areas are able to achieve at least 10000 lux of daylight for at least a low-light plant to grow well.  "

	<text-only title="dEFINE your own living" content="Individual household will have its living pattern and this can be identified from the various unit layouts that are co-created by them. They could use different wall and floor materials to define their own interior space, making their home to suit their living style. With different types of windows opening at the facade, various interactions could occur between the residents inside the unit and those who are at the corridor outside their unit. 
	<br><br>
	Individual household's privacy is also part of the concerns and  hence the residents could choose different types of windows opening for different rooms. For instance, they could choose to have partial height windows with curtain at the facade for the bedroom which faces the common corridor to maintain a certain level of privacy. On the other hand, the living room and dining area could have full height sliding glass doors to have the access to the corridor and the private balcony outdoor while at the same time to ensure these common areas are well lit in the daytime.

	<br><br>
	For instance in 2025, this particular 5 pax household consists of a couple with a son and 2 daughters, living in this L size duplex loft unit with all the private and shared spaces being well planned and customized for them.
	In 5 years time, the son and one of the daughter would like to move out to have their own living. This household decided to sell off their 2nd floor of the duplex loft unit and convert the 1st storey into a single storey S size unit. 
	In another 5 more years, another daughter has decided to move out to have her own living while the son and his wife have moved back to take care of his parents as they are getting older. Coincidently, the neighbouring unit would wish to reduce the unit size and is willing to sell part of their unit to them. They could extend then the S size unit to a single storey M size unit to better fit their needs and accommodate their living patterns.

This particular scene is the hdb estate at Toa Payoh Lorong 8, whereby the readaptation provides possible ways of transformation and more dimensions for interaction, thus creates a more livable and sustainable housing community for all generations in Singapore.
