    main-title="Summary"
    summary="It is noticeable that more than 80% of Singaporeans live in the public housing that is built and planned by the Housing and Development board (HDB). The design of a good quality housing is therefore always a challenging task particularly in Singapore, given that it is land and resource constrained and be it one of the highly dense and urbanized countries in the world. Furthermore, due to its fixed unit layout, can the public housing accommodate to the demographic changes over its lifetime?

    <br><br>  
    This thesis aims to research on ways to extend the lifespan of the housing in the past era, by involving broad participation at different levels, and inviting continuous transformation over time, through studying on the living patterns of the individual households, to accommodate demographic and demand changes. It envisions to regenerate a new housing paradigm from the existing structural system through adopting adaptable and flexible infill system of the building. In addition, to challenge the homogeneity of housing, and re-empower the dwellers in co-creating their dwellings, the  process of design would engage the future users and residents, thereby creating a livable and resilient environment for the community even in a high-density context."

    aboutme="Hui Sin is a Master's Student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), pursuing her Masters of Architecture. She always believes that an inspiring design can affect oneâ€™s life. Nature itself is already a perfect system for people to live in, while bringing in the architecture to help the people to live better; she is constantly exploring on ways to allow architecture to communicate with the nature, making it a plus on top of the nature system.

    title="69 Moulmein Road"
    text="Block 69 Moulmein Road is interestingly placed at the intersection of Moulmein Road and the Central Expressway (CTE) exit 7A. It is uncommon since it stands alone among a private housing neighborhood, where the nearest clusters of public housing is across the CTE at Rangoon and Cambridge Road.. 
	<br><br>
	In the past, where the CTE presently runs was previously an estate of low-rise Singapore Improvement Trust flats. In fact, block 69 Moulmein Road was the first of a new typology of conventional point blocks built by the HDB in the early 1970s. 
	<br><br>
	Block 69 Moulmein Road is constructed in 1972 and open to the public on 7 January 1972. It received 700 entries to purchase 76 unites of 4-room flats where the demand was considered quite high during that period.
	When the apartments in Whampoa estate were planned to be upgraded in 1999, block 69 Moulmein Road were reportedly left out of the scheme until dwellers requested the government and HDB to be included. 
	<br><br>
	Studies shown below is to understand the site better. This thesis will reuse the exisitng building system and regenerate a new housing paradigm to serve the 1970s housing society. Furthermore, wind and daylight studies are also taken into account to improve the living condition and quality of the residents."

    title="2D Permutations" 
    text="After setting the areas for different types of unit according to the typical types of units provided by the HDB, ie. XS unit is equivalent to the 2-room flexi unit and L unit is equivalent to the 5-room unit, I then study their possible ways to fit in the existing structural system.
	The purpose is to maximize the number of units per floor and hence making the usage of the area more efficient. "
