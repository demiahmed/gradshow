    main-title="Thesis Context & Aims"
    summary="Malls along Orchard Road are less patronised due to the growing presence of online shopping. Yet, online shopping focuses on convenience and individual engagement. In the digital age meant to connect us, people are ironically becoming more physically and emotionally estranged. Collectively, shopping has lost its social purpose originally intended by Victor Gruen: to bring people back together and create community synchronicity. Social interaction has always been at the heart of traditional shopping and has proven to work. In the words of William H. Whyte, 'What attracts people most, it would appear, is other people.'. People yearn to partake in the communal activities and online shopping will not replace its physical counterpart.
	<br><br>
	Presently, the street level of Singapore’s shopping core (Orchard Road) is primarily dominated by vehicle circulation and fails to truly connect shoppers. Highly regulated by barriers, shoppers are forced to remain in the side-lines. The rigidity, coupled with the humid and hot weather, has thus made underground linkways the preferred choice of route due to the comfort its artificial climate offers. However, these underground linkways are very much detached from the street, which Whyte describes as ‘the river of life of the city’.
	<br><br>
	This thesis imagines how Orchard Road as a shopping core can be revitalised by employing street-level non-spaces to bridge between existing malls. It will explore how architecture can provide a thermally comfortable space within a tropical climate to connect people more organically and visually to the street and to each other, thereby serving as a catalyst to revitalise Orchard Road as a whole."

    aboutme="I am an M.Arch student from the SUTD (graduating Dec 2021). My interests lie in understanding how design connects people to spaces and to the context that surrounds them, ultimately fostering communities and shared memories. I believe in practical and intuitive solutions made compelling through aesthetically elegant design. More importantly, I believe that the best designs stem from effective collaboration through individual competency and good teamwork."
