    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis seeks to reimagine the housing landscape for migrant construction workers.It envisions an alternative model of housing that is decentralised,porous and integrated with the local fabric.
    <br><br>  
    Overall this thesis aims to step away from the self-contained mega dormitory typology that dominates the migrant worker housing landscape and explore housing solutions that can be better encourage local-migrant interaction and integrate dormitories with the surrounding community. 
	<br><br>  
	The integration of dormitories into local neighbourhood is not be a straightforward task, as it is difficult to force interactions between people with little in common. This thesis therefore focuses on particular segments of the population (namely the urban poor) ,that share common challenges and have similar needs as migrant workers, and explores the possiblity of integration between the two demographics."

    aboutme="   
    Hi there, my name is Samson and I'm a Master of Architecture student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I believe architecture has the power to create social change and improve our daily lives. I constantly seek to be inspired by good design and learn more about how I can incorporate sustainability in my designs as a future architect.
	<br><br>
	In my free time I enjoy trekking,reading books and exploring buildings.

    title="Inclusivity" 
    text="NIMBYism in Singapore extends beyond our attitudes towards migrant construction workers. We see similar discrimination towards the urban poor who live in rental flats. A future with more inclusive accomodation should therefore not only encompass migrant workers but also seek to provide a decent living for those who have fallen through the cracks.

   title="Unit Design" 
   text="A flexible partition wall shared between every two units allow for variety of living arrangements. This flexible arrangement also allows the development to anticipate the future decline in the migrant worker population ,who may eventually go back to their home countries, as singapore tries to reduce its reliance on migrant workers.Eventually, the building can transition from a typical rental model to one of ownership, as migrant workers shift out and the initial rental units residents are able to earn enough to purchase a house of their own.
