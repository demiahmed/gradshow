    main-title="Summary"
    summary="This thesis seeks to reimagine the housing landscape for migrant construction workers.It envisions an alternative model of housing that is decentralised,porous and integrated with the local fabric.
    <br><br>  
    Overall this thesis aims to step away from the self-contained mega dormitory typology that dominates the migrant worker housing landscape and explore housing solutions that can be better encourage local-migrant interaction and integrate dormitories with the surrounding community."

    title="Abstract" 
    text="Migrant workers play a crucial role in the construction of our built environment. Yet despite their immense   contribution to society, they remain one of  the most marginalised  communities in Singapore. They are often housed in far-flung industrial areas of the country in poor living conditions, living separate but paralllel lives from the average Singaporean. The  social segration is largely a result of racism and politicking that has gone unaddressed. 

The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed some of the flaws of a highly densed centralised model of housing, and undercurrents of xenophobia that are still pervasive in Singapore. The government has taken a step forward to  de-densify the dormitories, but   the building of dormitories within residential zones still remains a highly contentious issue, with little progress made to address the the not-in-my-backyard syndrome rife in Singapore.."

    title="Design Proposal"
    text=" The design proposal of this thesis involves extending the existing  the J walk and create a new branch that will help bridge the site. The new site will also house new dormitories mixed in  with rental flats  and  the Site becomes an inclusive nexus that strengthens relationship among the public, migrant workers and the urban poor . In terms of programs ,the new site will cater to both the urban poor and migrant workers. The two groups share very similar needs, from receiving food aid from NGOs ,lacking in access to recreational activities , and technology, and also requiring additional  terms of upskilling and finding jobs . so these are just some of the possible programs the site can have. For instance there can be a central node for food collection and distribution run by NGO volunteers, a community centre or a library where various NGOs can come together to organise recreational activities for the residents , and lastly a market place where home based businesses can sell their crafts and baked goods
