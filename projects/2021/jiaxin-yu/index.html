    summary="The weary body of a city dweller often desires refuge in nature retreats. However this need to displace the body is more than just a simple desire to ‘destress’. As architects, we need to first study how the urban space is overstimulating the body before we can truly begin to provide restorative solutions.
    <br><br>  
    From breaking down the experience and expressions of body stress in terms of spatial behaviour, to strategic spatial planning influenced by nature, this research utilises science of the multi-sensory human body to provide new perspectives in spatial planning. The result is an experimentation of such a wellness resort, in the mountains of Bali.

    student-title="About Me"
    aboutme="The complex relationship between humans and our environment has always been a personal fascination of mine. And in this unsettling Covid era, we are all forced to reflect on mankind’s entanglement with nature. As uncertainty feeds anxiety and confinement breaks down body wellness, I believe there is no better time to understand how the built environment is stimulating and exacerbating stress on our bodies. With the help of science, we can perhaps begin to find new design approaches for a calmer city."

    title="Geography"
    text="Sunrise on the hills of Bali occurs between 0530 to 0630, from the North-East during the June solstice and the South-East during the December solstice, relative to the hills of Melanting Waterfall. Sunset occurs between 1800 to 1830, from the North-West  during the June solstice and the South-West during the December solstice. Considering the extensively undulating geography, the choice of landing a house on the hill is tricky. Directionality of rooms is important in order to receive or avoid sunlight, while not being hindered by the folds of the hills."

    title="Weather"
    text="Bali follows the tropical weather, with rainy seasons between November to April and dry seasons from May to October. Thus the level of precipitation can range from as low as 15mm around August to as high as 1700mm around December. Yet, the temperature remains generally stable throughout the year at a warm 26 - 30 degrees Celsius. However on the hills, nightfall may bring temperature drops. As an island, there is abundance of sea breeze, blowing from the South-East."
