    main-title="Summary"
    summary="<p><i>Strato</i>(“layer”)<i>cumulus</i>(“heap”) Clouds are a layer of puffy,  low-lying clouds. Large and autonomous, they emerge as a response to a set of specific environmental conditions. Architecture has long toyed with the idea of responsive, active systems, and the integration of computation into architectural infrastructure, empowers it to adapt and respond to user needs and external stimuli, processing complex environmental information in real-time. This brings the promise of a resilience that the static paradigm cannot afford.
    <br><br> 
    <p><i>Stratoculmuliform Envelope</i> imagines a soft, moving, permeable skin as the mediator between the human infrastructure and our environment. This thesis explores the use of a large-scale active-responsive system that manipulates windflow and ventilation as a means of disrupting the undesirable heating effects of the city."

    title="Responsive Architecture" 
    text="The most prevalent way buildings in our current age respond to the environment is through building control systems. These systems often rely heavily on air-conditioning – pumping cool air around and releasing hot air into the environment to create a comfortable interior microclimate. This method is problematic, further exacerbating the heat it works to mitigate.
    Research into responsive building skins seeks to provide a sustainable alternative. 
    Passive-responsive systems leverage inherent material properties, for example hygroscopy or bimetallics, as well as intelligent geometry to directly respond to changes in the external environment. Active-responsive systems use sensors to determine environmental data, and adjust their mechanical systems accordingly.
    <br><br>
    Drawing inspiration from speculative architecture of the 60s, this thesis explores the use of an active system on a large-scale, to address the city-scale heat problems many developed countries face. This high-performance, naturally ventilated envelope was developed with three strategies to regulate shading and windflow. 
    <br><br>
    Through extensive CFD studies, the use of an <i>envelope mass</i> to induce ground-level windflow was investigated. 
    A <i>structural system</i> for this geometry was developed based on case studies, with the goal of a large-spanning, adaptable, and lightweight structure, that would also be able to support the programs it houses, using a rainwater collection system and solar cells. 
    <i>Responsive cells</i> populate the surface of this envelope. Designed around underactuation, bistabilty and knit-membrane research, this ephemeral panelling seeks to actively augment the interior microclimate. Sensors receive environmental data, which is processed with an AI control unit, adjusting the individually-addressable cells to responding to environmental changes."

    title="Heat Island and the Site" 
    text="Singapore is no stranger to Urban Heat Island effect, as seen from the mapping above, derived from a simulation found in <i>Cooling Singapore</i>’s Potential of District Cooling in Singapore: From Micro to Mesoscale report (Riegelbauer et al., 2020).
    A site in Rochor was to selected on the basis of: 
     <br><br> 
     1. The severity of the effects of UHI effect on the area, 
     <br><br> 
     2. Its concentration of clustered, low-mid rise commercial developments–namely conserved shophouses, which utilize the surrounding streets for circulation, 
     <br><br> 
     3. The vacant plot in between Kampong Glam and Little India, though well connected, is victim to an absence of city grain and high exposure to sunlight.
    <br><br> 
    The programmatic mapping on the right shows its diverse offering – ranging from intimate, everyday housing developments, to commercial mixed-use malls, along with its excellent connectivity, it is understandable why it is traversed by many diverse demographics. 
    This site specifically is in close proximity to three distinct characters in Rochor's urban fabric.

    text="
    The site is opposite what used to be Rochor Centre – the iconic multi-colored HDB tower and podium development. Sungei Rd Thieves Market used to operate on the site and was also recently removed. Finally Ban San Bus Terminal, which remains in the plot adjacent to the site, is behind many locals' fond memories of weekend getaways to Johor Bahru.
    <br><br>
    Referencing surrounding programs as well as the three icons of the area, a rough zoning of activities began to emerge. Imposing the 30x30m structural grid of the Envelope onto the site helped further organise the zoning.

    title="New Access and Modules" 
    text="
    This scheme proposes the relocation of the bus terminal to the site, where it can benefit from larger and new facilities, within a pleasant microclimate. Additionally, four modules of varying scales were designed accoring to 5m subdivisions of the grid. They fall along the spectrum of <i>Intimate</i> and <i>Commercial</i>, and can be reconfigured across the site – allowing the scheme to adapt to changing user needs. 
    This combination of a fixed access sceheme (MRT Station, Bus Terminal and Pedestrian Paths) coupled with the reconfigurable modules, placed within the grid system, create a flexible and usable civic space.

    title="The Envelope Mass" 
    content="Based on prior CFD studies, it was determined that a high dome with a concave meridian best induces windflow beneath it. Hence, the southern-facing end of the mass is tallest. The convex in the centre accounts for the dip in terrain, maintaining wind pressure in that area.
    <br><br> 
    Rows of responsive panels are placed perpendicular to the direction of dominant windlflow (South) where they are most effecive, and through adjusting their openings, the induced ground-level windflow is further augmented. 
    <br><br> 
    Three types of static panels serve to redirect rainwater runoff, such that its weight is better distributed over the envelope, and it is directed towards the tops of the columns, where it is collected.
