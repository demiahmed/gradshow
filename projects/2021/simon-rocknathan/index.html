    main-title="Summary"
    summary="<p><i>Strato</i>(“layer”)<i>cumulus</i>(“heap”) Clouds are a layer of puffy,  low-lying clouds. Large and autonomous, they emerge as a response to a set of specific environmental conditions. Architecture has long toyed with the idea of responsive, active systems, and the integration of computation into architectural infrastructure, empowers it to adapt and respond to user needs and external stimuli, processing complex environmental information in real-time. This brings the promise of a resilience that the static paradigm cannot afford.
    <br><br> 
    <p><i>Stratoculmuliform Envelope</i> imagines a soft, moving, permeable skin as the mediator between the human infrastructure and our environment. This thesis explores the use of a large-scale active-responsive system that manipulates windflow and ventilation as a means of disrupting the undesirable heating effects of the city."

    aboutme="Simon is a Master of Architecture graduate enthralled by architecture’s potential for generosity. His thesis was inspired by the desire for an architecture that expresses sensitivity to its surrounding environment, his interest in architecture technologies and fabrication, and the story of an extra-dimensional squid."

    title="Responsive Architecture" 
    text="The most prevalent way buildings in our current age respond to the environment is through building control systems. These systems often rely heavily on air-conditioning – pumping cool air around and releasing hot air into the environment to create a comfortable interior microclimate. This method i problematic, furher exacerbating the heat it works to mitigate.
    <br><br>
    Research into responsive building skins seeks to provide a sustainable alternative. 
    Passive-responsive systems leverage inherent material properties, for example hygroscopy or bimetaliics, as well as intelligent geometry to directly respond to changes in the external environment. Active-responsive systems use sensors to determine environmental data, and adjust their mechanical systems accordingly.
    <br><br>
    Drawing inspiration from speculative architecture of the 60s, this thesis explores the use of an active system on a large-scale, to address the city-scale heat problems many developed countries face. This high-performance, naturally ventilated envelope was developed with three strategies to "

    text="Singapore is no strangerr to Urban Heat Island effect, as seen from the ampping above,derived from a simulation found in <i>Cooling Singapore</i>’s Potential of District Cooling in Singapore: From Micro to Mesoscale report (Riegelbauer et al., 2020).
     The site on Rochor was selected because of: 1. The severity of the effects of UHI effect on the area, 2. Its concentration of clustered, low-mid rise commercial developments–namely conserved shophouses, makes it a great candidate for the system, and 3. The vacant plot in between Kampong Glam and Little India, though well connected, is victim to an absence of city grain and high exposure to sunlight.
    <br><br> 
    The programmatic mapping on the left shows its diverse offering – ranging from intimate, everyday houding developments, to commercial mixed-use malls, it is understandable why it is traverse by many diverse demographics. This site specifically is in close proximity to three distinct characters in Rochor's urban fabric. It is opposite what used to be Rochor Centre – the iconic multi-colored HDB tower and podium development. The Sungei Rd Thieves Market operated on the site and was also recently removed. And finally Ban San Bus Terminal, which remains in the plot adjacent to the site – behind many locals' fond memories of weekend getaways to Johor Bahru."

    title="Siting Programs" 
    content="Referencing the surrounding programs as well as the three icons of the area, a rough zoning of activities began to emerge. Imposing the 30x30m structural grid of the Envelope onto the site helped further organise the zoning. A circulatioN scheme was proposed, taking into account the existing MRT station and relocating the bus terminal as it would benefit from a naturally ventilated canopy. With 5m subdivisions, modules corresponding to the spectrum of <i>Intimate</i> and <i>Commercial</i> were developed. This system allows for flexibily of programs and innumerable configurations, maximizing the space."
