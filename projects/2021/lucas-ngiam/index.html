    main-title="Living With the Wild"
    summary="Preserving the global biodiversity is crucial in maintaining the natural environments that produces many essential natural services that humanity relies on. However, many urban developments have caused fragmentation and reduction of the Earth's wild spaces, causing a decline - or even extinction - of many of the world's wildlife.
    <br><br>
    With sustainability slowly becoming an essential feature in building designs, could there be an opportunity for urban developments to function with a biodiverse community? As the term 'nature' relates to both flora and fauna, designing with the coexistence of nature and urban in mind should not be limited to the incorporation of plants into the urban environments. Instead, could there be a possibility to replan and design cities to reconnect fragmented natural environments and create safe spaces for wildlife to recover, while redefining the urban experience, expectations and needs? 
    <br><br>
    With a focus in Singapore, this thesis proposes the idea of replanning existing urban environments to reconnect the surviving natural habitats and any local conservation efforts for wildlife to traverse and make their journey to regroup with the other surviving population. It also studies how housing, and urban life, can be immersed, and adapted within a wild environment to meet Singapore's high population density."

    title="The Context"
    text="A strong biodiversity leads to healthy ecosystems, which provide a multitude of benefits to both wildlife and man. However, the unsustainable consumption of the world's supplies have damaged nature's ability to sustain all these ecosystem services. According to WWF's Living Planet Report, the current consumption model has resulted in an average decline of 68% of the global biodiversity since 1970, with Asia Pacific's faring the worst according to how much of its biodiversity is left intact.
    <br><br>
    This is a problem because the more an ecosystem's biodiversity gets damaged, the less resilient the ecosystem becomes.  
    <br><br>
    Southeast Asia's tropical forests are home to around 20% of the global biodiversity. In order to maintain or improve its resilience, it is important to help preserve its local biodiversity - especially with the region losing at least 1% of its forest footprint annually.
    <br><br>
    Singapore is one of the worst offenders within the region. Rapid urbanization for economic purposes since post-colonization resulted in less than 5% of Singapore's original forest footprint surviving. This led to at least 28% of its original ecological community becoming extinct due to loss of their natural habitats
    <br><br><br>
    Urban developments fragment our environments and fragmentation negatively affects inhabitant wildlife populations -  as patches of core natural habitats becomes smaller and isolated, there are less viable spaces for homes for species that are dependent on these core habitats. It also increases the edge effect, increasing the possibility of urban wildlife conflicts and consequently cause their population to decline."

    title="The Decline"
    text="This decline is happening to all species, including the keystone species - as its name suggest, these species are crucial to the ecosystem due to their low level of functional redundancy. This means no alternate species could fulfil its ecological role and its extinction would lead to a radically different ecosystem or the collapse of the entire ecosystem.
    <br><br>
    Taking the Pangolins as an example - as it travels by land, it is constantly under threat from various form of urban wildlife conflict because of fragmented environments such as roadkills.  
    <br><br>
    As shown by the accompanying illustration, the number of roadkill incidents involving Pangolins are concentrated around the Central Cachment Nature Reserve. This depicts the struggle the Pangolins have to go through as they attempt to seek new suitable habitats - unlike flying wildlife, pangolins are unlikely to be able to travel safely between the various forested areas around Singapore.
    Even if they survive the crossing of our road networks, they might be trapped or be accidentally killed by unaware or apathetic pedestrians within the urban environments.
    <br><br>
    The lack of safe circulation to the various natural habitats also limits the gene flow among the population. This results in inbreeding depression among the various clusters, causing population number to suffer. With typically only one offspring each reproduction cycle, it is a huge concern for the survivability of the Pangolin population."

    title="The Criticisms"
    text="Singapore does have some existing conservation strategies and in theory, they have their merits in conserving Singapore's biodiversity. However, there are some concerning limitations to these strategies. 
    <br><br>
    One of the major criticism is that the objective of a continuous ecological connection is marred by current urban constraints. Ecological networks like the green corridor and park connectors, are broken up into smaller disjointed segments which contradicts the idea of reconnecting the fragmented environment, and it still places the targeted species at risk of wildlife-human conflicts. Their current locations also limits the selection of vegetation which limits the variety of wildlife that the network can support. As such, you will often hear how these strategies help birds or butterflies, but not other non-flying fauna. 
    <br><br>
    Many strategies also boast urban activities, which help succeed in bringing city dwellers physically close to nature. However, it would also increase in the amount of unintended human-wildlife interactions. Some of the animals may then behave aggressively towards pedestrians if stressed or are expecting food. Aggression might lead to attacks on the pedestrians, which may result in the latter calling for these wildlife to be put down.  
    <br><br>
    To become more conscious towards conservation of biodiversity, there is a need to tweak some of the strategies to address these criticisms."

    <text-image
    title="The Masterplan"
    text="A possible start for a more comprehensive conservation strategy could be done by introducing a reimagined continuous wildlife corridor network around Singapore's nature reserves and other known habitats. 
    <br><br>
    After analysing the different forms of Wildlands-Urban Interfaces (WUI) within Singapore, the reimagined wildlife corridor has been zoned to connect the identified Interface WUI communities, in addition to the conditions listed on the right. This was meant to create an uninterrupted and safe passage for wildlife through major parks and green spaces around Singapore as they travel out of their home habitat. 
    <br><br>
    With land scarcity a problem in Singapore, it would be impractical to tear down all the buildings that lies between the drawn boundaries of the wildlife corridor. Therefore, there is a need to be selective with the parcels that should be redeveloped. Selection of parcels would be based on expiring land leases and their proximity to major parks and waterbodies. 
    <br><br>
    Selected parcels are then classified into either urban zones (T5-T6) or rural zones (T1-T2) - urban zones will consist of higher density properties that could house the displaced residents and businesses while the rural zones' redevelopment will see the rewilding of the area."

    title="The Site"
    text="To further investigate the scenario in how the residential typology might function in conjunction with this new wildlife corridor within the rural zones, the residential area between Pasir Ris Park and Tampines Ecogreen was chosen as the site of intervention.
    <br><br>
    With the current site condition, there is a need to introduce ecoducts, or what we know as eco-links, across the main thoroughfares to connect the three main green spaces of 1) Pasir Ris Park, 2) Pasir Ris Town Park and 3) Tampines Ecogreen.
    <br><br>
    With the introduction of ecoducts and the removal of some of the existing HDB buildings within the rural zone through the Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme, rewilding the planned connection becomes possible. However, with Singapore's population density being one of the highest in the world, every piece of land is important.   
    <br><br>
    Thus, it brings us to the question: could this corridor be more than just a haven for wildlife? Is there an opportunity to utilise the rewilded land for residential purposes without damaging its ecology by living with it harmoniously?
    <br><br>
    As nature involves both plants and animals, building designs should progress away from only designing with greenery in mind and fully immerse the residential typology into the wild in its entirety - so as to help facilitate the understanding and appreciation of both greenery and wildlife while creating a biodiverse community within a precinct.

    title="The Building - Forest Synergy" 
    text="To successfully create a habitable space for a biodiverse community, both the wild spaces and the urban spaces must work interdependently. While the development aims to build a connection between humans and wildlife through interactions, there must also be a relationship between architecture and the landscape that surrounds it.
    <br><br>
    Naturally, forests are made up of several layers of vegetation and various animals use these different forest layers to find food and shelter - humans included.
    <br><br>
    Hence, these different layers are also brought into the consideration in the makeup of the residential development's landscape. With these layers, the architecture benefits from the buffer that the forest offers - from passively cooling the units to providing acoustic and dust protection.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, the forest also stands to benefit from the presence of the architecture; from being a source of water through greywater recycling to providing shade through the overhead PV panels canopy, the architecture is able to play a part in the forest's growth and upkeep.

    title="The Residential Tree"
    text="For the residential towers, the typical configuration is a combination of a 3 room and 4 room housing units. With the analogy of a tree, each residential block can be classified into 3 zones: the roots, trunks and leaves and branches - and specific programs are found within each of these zones. 
    <br><br>
    Firstly, the roots zone's main feature is an indoor observatory that is embedded in the natural landscape of the wildlife corridor, to allow residents and guests to get as close they can get to ground level and view any wildlife that might be passing by. Residents and guests may also choose to exit the observatory and access an enclosed garden to be closer to the adjacent wildlife and greenery.  
    <br><br>
    The trunk zone's primary function differs from block to block as the space can be configured to accommodate different programs that benefits the precinct. Some of these programs can be an elderly care facility, to a childcare centre to even a food hall with an indoor farming facility that residents and guests can enjoy. Furthermore, the outdoor spaces that lies within the trunk allows users to enjoy the sights of greenery and wildlife and various heights - effectively becoming an outdoor observatory. 
    <br><br>
    The remaining floors belong to the leaves and the branches zone. These are where the 3 room and 4 room residential units are located. These double storey units are attached to the central core and circulation passages are present if there are any adjacent residential blocks. Communal recreational spaces can also be found along the connection between the units and along the connector between different residential blocks. 
    <br><br>
    Together with the double storey design, a larger floor area must be allocated to the balconies to allow the growth of larger and taller vegetation. Hence, the 3 room and 4 room housing units were intentionally designed to have more than 15% of its floor area to be allocated to green spaces. These green spaces were meant to mediate the outdoor wild spaces and the indoor spaces of the units."

    <text-only title="The Tree of Life" 
    content=" Facing the north and south side of the site, there are two towers that are configured with co-working and living unit apartments instead. This was done with the intention of providing spaces that assist with the conservation of biodiversity; to place an emphasis on programs related to the rescue and care of wildlife that travel across the precinct. 
    <br><br>
    The roots zone now features a rescue and release zone as its opening faces the ecolinks, allowing wildlife caretakers and volunteers to quickly respond to any emergencies that they might come across or prep the release of wildlife back into the wild after their rehabilitation.  
    <br><br>
    An animal hospital is programmed at the trunk of this configuration - complete with equipment that are necessary to cater to the various needs that the rescued wildlife might have.
    Besides treating and rehabilitating the wildlife, the hospital was to provide an opportunity for residents and guests to be learn more about the wildlife and the care that they need. Hence, on certain floors, residents and guests can view what goes about within the hospital - from the research that the staff are involved in, to the various treatment procedures that the wildlife might undergo.
    <br><br>
    To provide a positive healing experience for the wildlife, the hospital is programmed in a way where the wildlife and the public are physically kept apart. Additionally, certain programs are positioned away from the eyes of any onlookers such as their wards or more serious operations such as invasive surgeries.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, similar to the previous configuration, the leaves and branches zone hold the co-working and living units. These units feature two distinct parts - a coworking space on the lower floor and co-living space on the upper floor. These units are for volunteers and staff who wishes to stay on site or for individuals who wishes to stay near their working space. Large green spaces are also allocated to both variations of the unit plan to mediate between the outdoor wild spaces and the indoors.

    title="The Gardens" 
    text="Although there is the intention of nurturing a positive human-animal interaction, some human-animal interactions may only be beneficial for one party but not the other. This is especially true when the animals and humans are not acclimatized to one another. 
    <br><br>
    Both parties may feel stressed or scared upon interaction, which may lead to more severe scenarios, such as animal abuse, neglect, and animal bites. These negative experiences pose a risk to both humans and animals, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that it may take time for both parties to get used to one another. 
    <br><br>
    Thus, preliminary human-animal interactions are initially limited within the roots zone, where enclosed gardens are introduced to facilitate the interaction between both parties in a safer manner. 
    <br><br>
    The gardens can be compared to the public space of an animal exhibit - with the main forest separated from the publicly accessible garden space through the use of ha-has (trenches)."

    <text-only title="The Changes Over Time" content="Only after a number of years of getting used to living with the wildlife, the new generation of residents and wildlife may determine that it is safe to be in closer proximity to one another. 
    <br> Thus, some phasing strategy can be included into the development.  
    <br><br>
    Adding or altering certain existing wildlife conservation infrastructure could be done in strategic locations, first working from the roots and subsequently within the public spaces at the leaves and branches. 
    <br><br>
    This phasing strategy can be progressive as well - where small changes such as adding feeding points for birds and squirrels can be done earlier to bigger changes such as removing the ha-ha to allow the various wildlife to share the garden spaces."> </text-only>
