    main-title="Living With the Wild"
    summary="Designing with the coexistence of nature and urban should not be limited to new developments that would be built on top of natural environments; instead could there be a possibility to replan and design cities to reconnect fragmented natural environments and create safe spaces for wildlife to recover, while redefining the urban experience, expectations and needs?
    <br><br>
    With a focus in Singapore, this thesis proposes the idea of replanning existing urban environments to reconnect the surviving natural habitats and any local conservation efforts for wildlife to traverse and make their journey to regroup with the other surviving population, while studying the redistribution of density needed to accomplish this."

    title="The Residential 'Tree'"
    text="With the analogy of a tree, each block can be classified into 3 zones: firstly, the roots. It features an underground drop off point at B2, and it is the main lobby for residents to head back to their homes. The roots also features an indoor observatory at B1, that is embedded in the natural landscape of the wildlife corridor, to allow residents and guests to get as close they can get to ground level and view any wildlife that might be passing by. 
    <br><br>
    From level 1 to 6, we have the trunk: In this initial stage, its primary function is to provide communal spaces for all residents and guests. Its secondary function is to become an outdoor observatory where users will be able to look at the various animals and plants at different height. Thus, staying within the trunk allows users to surround themselves with nature while socialising with one another. 
    <br><br>
    Level 7 to 22 are the leaves and the branches: these are where the residential units are located. The double story units are attached to the central core and features circulation passages are present if there are any adjacent residential blocks. Communal Recreational spaces can also be found along the connection between the units and along the connector between different residential blocks. 
    <br><br>
    In order to meet the required density, 10 residential blocks (or 'trees') are erected within the development zone. For the layout of the development, there are two sets of typical floor plans: the first will have a focus on more residential units while providing a continuous connection between the 10 blocks, whereas the second set have a greater focus on creating more communal spaces to compensate for the lack of access to the other blocks."

    title="The Reconnection with Nature" 
    text="When we talk about reconnecting with nature, we tend to forget that nature also involves the animals that live among the green. The potential benefits of a positive human-animal interaction are like those that we get from immersing ourselves in greenery. However, some Human-Animal Interactions may only be beneficial for one party but not the other, especially in cases where the animal has not been acclimatized to humans prior to the interaction.
    <br><br>
    Therefore, some phasing strategy is necessary, adding or altering certain existing wildlife conservation infrastructure to the residential 'tree' after a number of years. This is to acknowledge that it may take time for both wildlife and humans to get used to one another.
    <br><br>
    While the development aims to bridge the connection to wildlife, there must be a relationship between architecture and the landscape that surrounds it. Naturally, forests are made up of several layers of vegetation and various animals use these different forest layers to find food and shelter - humans included.
    <br><br>
    Hence, these different layers are also brought into the consideration in the makeup of the residential development's landscape. With these layers, the architecture benefits from the buffer that the forest offers: from passively cooling the units to providing acoustic and dust protection."
