    <title-text title="Earth Architecture in Disaster Recovery"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="<p style='text-align:justify'> Every year, natural disasters kill approximately 60,000 people and cause an average of 24.5 million people to be displaced from their homes. The majority of the deaths are caused by building collapse in earthquakes, in which around 90% occur in developing countries.
    <br><br>  
    The thesis aims to propose a post-disaster temporary houses for developing countries in the medium to long-term recovery. The objective is to develop a system that is affordable, locally sourced, and readily deployable. Moreover, it looks into sustainable and environmentally-friendly solutions.
The research explores earth as it is a potential material that fits the criteria.</p>"

    title="Phases of Disaster Recovery" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'> Every disaster event is unique. But typically, right after disaster, it will be followed by, first, the emergency phase, then restoration phase, reconstruction I phase, and finally reconstruction II. The thesis focuses on the Reconstruction I phase. It is the period where it is uncertain for how long they will be staying in these temporary houses. Also, it is an important phase where not only permanent physical structures are being built, but the social fabric of communities are also strengthened.</p>"

    title="Earth as Building Material"
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'> Considering the criteria for a post-disaster neighbourhood for medium to long term period, earth brick would be suitable material. First, The material can be locally sourced, hence it is affordable. Only simple tools are needed so the residents can actually build their own hosues together. Besides resulting in cheaper construction cost, this would bring a sense of participation and support system in the community as well. Locally sourced materials would also minimize the reliance on external suppliers, especially from other countries, which can sometimes be a challenge. Lastly, after these houses are not in use anymore, earth can be returned back with minimized waste to the environment.</p>"

    title="Earthquake Resistant Strategies" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'> It is important for the houses to be earthquake-resistant since they are in earthquake-prone area. Some strategies include, firstly, using cane or timber as internal reinforcement. The elements are placed vertically and horizontally in between adobe blocks. This has been tested on a adobe house in a full scale shaking table and showed good result. They can be applied as external reinforcement as well. It is placed vertically on the external wall and are secured with ropes. Finishing material such as plaster can be added to better confine the overall structure and give adequate finishing. Secondly, synthetic meshes laid vertically and horizontally on external walls result in improvement in ductility and lateral strength. Lastly, on top of that, it is also possible to nail with metallic bottle caps against the adobe and then covering it with cement mortar.</p>"

    title="Existing Houses" 
    text="<p style='text-align:justify'> It can be seen that many existing houses in Sulawesi have a large shaded intermediate space between the street and the actual house. They seem to function differently for each houses as well, which can be their own shops, or rest areas, or space to hang their clothes. There are also a lot of small alleys as access to more houses behind.
<br><br>
On top of that, to provide a familiar setting for the residents, the typical floor plans of existing local houses are studied and then optimized to efficiently provide living space for the residents. The core private zones are remained, while the rest of the space, such as living and dining area, would be shared. The 2 base modules, as seen on the following diagram, was the agglomerated to anaylse the spatial quality of the resultant shared space.
<br><br>
The 3 selected clusters are as follows. Cluster A & B can house up to 8 people while Cluster C can house up to 16 people. Moreover, a community centre is provided for any support needed post-disaster, social space, and praying areas.</p>"
