    <title-text title="Post-Disaster Village: Earth Architecture in Disaster Recovery"></title-text>

    <project-bio 
    main-title="Summary"
    summary="Every year, natural disasters kill approximately 60,000 people and cause an average of 24.5 million people to be displaced from their homes. The majority of the deaths are caused by building collapse in earthquakes, in which around 90% occur in developing countries.
    <br><br>  
    The thesis explores earth architecture as a solution for a post-disaster neighbourhood in developing countries following a disaster event in the medium to long-term recovery.
The objective is to develop a system that is affordable, can be easily constructed but durable enough to last for several years, and able to cater for changes of the residents' lives."

    title="Phases of Disaster Recovery" 
    text="Every disaster event is unique. But typically, right after disaster, it will be followed by, first, the emergency phase, then restoration phase, reconstruction I phase, and finally reconstruction II. The thesis focuses on the Reconstruction I phase. It is the period where it is uncertain for how long they will be staying in these temporary houses. Also, it is an important phase where not only permanent physical structures are being built, but the social fabric of communities are also strengthened."

    title="Earth as Building Material"
    text="Considering the criteria for a post-disaster neighbourhood for medium to long term period, earth brick would be suitable material. First, The material can be locally sourced, hence it is affordable. Only simple tools are needed so the residents can actually build their own hosues together. Besides resulting in cheaper construction cost, this would bring a sense of participation and support system in the community as well. Locally sourced materials would also minimize the reliance on external suppliers, especially from other countries, which can sometimes be a challenge. Lastly, after these houses are not in use anymore, earth can be returned back with minimized waste to the environment."

    title="Earthquake Resistant Strategies" 
    text="It is important for the houses to be earthquake-resistant since they are in earthquake-prone area. Some strategies include using cane or timber as internal reinforcement. The elements are placed vertically and horizontally in between adobe blocks. This has been tested on a adobe house in a full scale shaking table and showed good result. These can be applied as external reinforcement as well. It is placed vertically on the external wall and are secured with ropes. Finishing material such as plaster can be added to better confine the overall structure and give adequate finishing."

    title="Extendable Temporary Housing" 
    text="It can be seen that many existing houses in Sulawesi have a large shaded intermediate space between the street and the actual house. They seem to function differently for each houses as well, which can be their own shops, or rest areas, or space to hang their clothes. There are also a lot of small alleys as access to more houses behind.
<br><br>
With that, to provide a familiar setting for the residents, the temporary housing are made to be adaptable for future changes of the residents' lives in the several years following the earthquake. "
