          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Despite having the potential of being a durable building material,
            Biorock, a form of calcium carbonate formed by the
            electro-accumulation of minerals dissolved in seawater, has never
            been applied on an architectural scale due to its slow accretion
            process. Until today, it has been mainly used for the restoration of
            coral reefs which do not maximise the strength of this material.
            However, in the context of marginalized and informal communities,
            this natural material accretion can be a sustainable procedure to
            gain building material resources. <br /><br />
            Economic gridlocked and dis-empowered governess in Jakarta create
            the inevitable reliance on community and alternative source of
            funding infrastructure development. This thesis plays out the
            possible narrative of this slow accruing material process in the
            incrementally submerged coastline of Jakarta. Local communities will
            be empowered to “grow” a new city for habitation using Biorock.
            Urban structures with basic communal, housing and aquaculture
            facilities will be established using Biorock as the main building
            structure, which would be harvested, transported and assembled over
            a period of 100 years with processes of accretion and unit
            aggregation.

          <h2>An Introduction: Sinking Jakarta</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, Jakarta now stands at the threshold of climate change
            with 40% of the city predicted to be completely submerged by 2050.
            Instead of finding solutions to save Jakarta from further damage,
            giant sea walls are simply being erected and plans have even been
            made to move the capital to Borneo. Currently Jakarta sits around 3m
            below sea levels and is prone to coastal floods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The two main causes of coastal floods are 1) sea level rise and 2)
            land subsidence. For Indonesia, the general rise of sea level in
            2030 will reach 15 cm to 18 cm. In 2050, sea level could increase by
            25 cm to 30, 40cm to 48 cm in 2080 and finally 50 cm to 60 cm in
            2100 . However, sea level rise accounts only a small % of why the
            capital city may be submerged. The bigger reason behind the sinking
            capital is attributed to its rapid subsidence. Jakarta is sinking at
            an average rate of 7.5 cm a year, in some places up to 17 cm.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To combat the issue at hand, the Giant Sea Wall Jakarta was
            constructed as part of the National Capital Integrated Coastal
            Development programme (NCICD). It commenced in 2014 and is expected
            to be materialized by 2025. However, this might not be sustainable
            in the long run. Firstly, the construction of the outer sea wall in
            Jakarta Bay will have a profound impact on the fishing communities
            in North Jakarta. Besides, there have been reports of constant
            leaking, which leaves the coastal villages of Jakarta constantly
            flooded. The sea wall has also collapsed several times in 2007 and
            2019, giving way to sudden coastal floods that inundated
            neighborhoods for days.

        <div class="mir_abstract">
          <h2>Design Methodology: Biodesign Fiction</h2>
          This clearly shows that the sea wall is not a reliable solution in the
          long run. Not only is it ineffective, but is also detrimental to
          communities around. This thesis instead seek to explore alternative
          methods of living through an enduring fabrication of a new living
          system that will eventually evolve into a sanctuary for communities to
          live in against unpredictable climatic conditions. The growth of the
          future living systems will be informed by a more natural and gradual
          process as opposed to the current curated and engineered means.
          “Biodesign fiction” which has gained traction over the years would be
          used as a speculative design approach to envision how biology can be
          useful in future, provocative scenarios. This thesis will specifically
          delve into the Biorock process which involves marine electrolysis and
          its potential to grow limestone building components, exploring how
          nature and human can design a co- produced space in an urban context.

          <h2>Biorock</h2>
          <p>
            Biorock refers to the cement-like substance formed by
            electro-accumulation of minerals dissolved in seawater. The process,
            developed by Wolf Hilbertz, was patented in 1979. It was determined
            that a low voltage would accrete aragonite, a form of calcium
            carbonate suitable as a building material. The material is three
            times harder that Portland concrete, becomes stronger with age and
            have self-repairing properties. Until today, it has been mainly used
            for the restoration of coral reefs which do not maximise the
            strength of this material. Despite the technical breakthrough,
            little exploration has been done to employ Biorock as a construction
            material.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is yet an architectural scale application of this promising
            material accretion methodology due to its slow accretion process.
            The dependency of accretion on natural cycles renders this process
            into a speed that is not typical to current material production
            standard practice. With low voltage, the Biorock can only grow up to
            2 cm per year. However, in the context of marginalized and informal
            communities, this natural material accretion can be a sustainable
            procedure to gain building material resources.

          <h2>Application: Harvest to Assembly</h2>
          <p>
            The research simulate over a period of 100 years the process of
            accretion and unit aggregation based on relationships and rules
            referenced from water access based on the changing water levels.
            There will be 4 stages involved namely harvest, transportation,
            storage and finally assembly before the final Biorock infrastructure
            is completed. These processes will revolve around the change in
            tidal conditions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            First, we start with harvesting of the Biorock component, which may
            happen for about 1-5 years depending on the thickness of accretion
            that is desired to be achieved.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wireframes are first harvested and left to accrete Biorock to
            achieve structural components within substantially deep waters,
            which would preferably mean the initial coastline of Jakarta. To
            identify where the components would be harvested, ocean current
            direction during the spring and monsoon seasons are first
            determined, as currents are essential in the accretion of Biorock to
            happen. The intersection of current direction during the two seasons
            are taken as harvesting nodes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The components are then transported to various sites to be
            assembled. Transportation would occur at high tide using boats.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The changes in tidal conditions would cause different levels and
            areas of submergence daily, monthly and yearly. Daily, tidal heights
            vary by about 1 metre. During the monsoon, tides may increase by 1-2
            metres and up to 5-8 metres during extreme weather events. Due to
            the constantly changing floodplains, specific routes for the
            transportation of Biorock will be mapped out. They will first reach
            storage points, highlighted by the bigger yellow border circle
            before assembly. Assembly would happen during extremely low tide or
            no tide conditions for work to be done more efficiently. Over the
            years, the area for assembly may then expand as more Biorock
            infrastructure is being harvested and transported inland, creating
            Biorock islands hubs throughout the city.

          The modules are 3-Dimensional T shaped of varying heights and lengths.
          The angle of the T shape may vary which allows either square shaped or
          diamond shaped enclosures to be formed when joined together.

            The module is broken down into two main parts - it would mainly be
            composed of a wireframe surface that allows the accretion of Biorock
            to occur. However, edges where the modules may connect with one
            another would be made of a metal that would not allow accretion to
            happen.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Assuming that Biorock accretion occurs at the rate of 2cm per year,
            we can see that the module becomes substantially denser over a
            period of 5 years in the catalogue below.

          <p>
            The Biorock infrastructure would first be build up on site, with the
            lower levels being much denser in accretion so as to be able to hold
            up the weight of the infrastructure. Putting lighter components
            above also make it less labour intensive for assembly. During
            periods of high tide daily or seasonally, the lower levels of
            Biorock components would be submerged in water, allowing for more
            accretion to take place, creating an even stronger foundation for
            more weight to be added on top later on.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Another important component of the infrastructure would be wooden
            floors and walls that would subsequently be added to the
            infrastructure after the wireframes Biorock modules have been
            aggregated. The walls would be placed in between the axis of the
            Biorock components connection points as shown in the this simplified
            exploded axonometric. This creates a variety of room configurations.

            This would be eventually how a potential Biorock island may look
            like, with a main core among existing buildings before extending out
            into the open sea creating a branching network.

          <br />
          <p>
            As for the programs on site, based on the characteristics of Biorock
            growth, it would be most ideal to have aquaculture as one of the
            main program, sea cucumber farming in particular helps with Biorock
            accretion. Aquaculture in general also benefits from Biorock
            accretion. Apart from that, housing would be the other main function
            of the system, with domestic industrial production such as tempe or
            tikar production integrated within. In the long run, by products
            such as biofuel or hydrogen gas from Biorock accretion and
            aquaculture may also be harnessed to power certain community needs.
            This would create a sustainable system for people to live within the
            Biorock island.

            Hence, the Biorock Island will consist of 3 main areas mainly the
            housing core, the aquaculture core and transport and storage nodes
            at the edges.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Within the housing cores, a few tower like multi-use hubs will be
            established and they may be connected to each other along an
            elevated platform. The different cores may serve different domestic
            functions apart from having housing. Within each hub there will also
            be the presence of public plazas and open decks. The cores will be
            characterized by the dense, large and high build-up of the modules
            and would usually surround urban buildings left behind.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            The aquaculture core on the other hand would be made up of different
            types of aquaculture hubs and routes, serving different functions
            such as shallow water and deep water aquaculture pods, sorting hubs,
            docks as well as Biorock storage fences. Based on fixed rules on
            which type of routes connect to which type of hubs, different zones
            within the aquaculture node will be created. These zones would
            include shallow water aquaculture housing sea cucumbers and certain
            shallow water fishes, which would be closer to the housing edge,
            deep water aquaculture housing oysters and deep water fishes, and
            finally Biorock storage and docks at the peripheries of the node.

          <p>
            The final images show how life may inhabitat the Biorock island with
            activities of domestic industries and aquaculture, against the
            remains of the city and against the existing city skyline further
            South that has been spared from the floods, highlighting how the
            old, the new and the flooded landscapes may coexist with one
            another.

            While developments in the initial phases would be focused on
            building infrastructure to create spaces to live and work for
            communities, the building system may eventually expand to support
            more complex programs such as water harvesting and even energy
            production to create a self-sustaining ecosystem to support
            communities as they continually rebuild cities in the constantly
            changing floodplains.
