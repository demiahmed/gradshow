        <div class="abstract">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            Urban villages are specific urban formations that emerged in many Chinese cities, caused by rapid industrialization and urbanization in the past four decades of economic boom. Originating from rural villages, their transformation hints an interesting discrepancy between top-down policy and its informal understanding and implementation by the individual actors or organizations in the village. This paper investigates the formation process of urban villages and explores potential interventions that could be implemented in the villages to improve their conditions.
	        <br><br>
	        This thesis will use Agent-based Modelling tools to experiment and simulate the possible impacts of proposed incremental changes on the villages. Agent-based modelling is a powerful simulation modelling technique that has seen may real-world applications. In agent-based modelling (ABM), a system is modelled as a collection of autonomous decision-making entities called agents, in the context of this thesis, could be the inhabitants of affected personals. Each agent individually assesses its situation and makes decisions based on a set of rules, which could be our proposed incremental changes. Agents may execute various behaviours appropriate for the system they represent. The level of influence of each rules (implementations) will vary based on research data aforehand. The simulation results will be used to prove if our predicted scenario will happen if the proposed measures are implemented.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            Urban villages are specific urban formations that emerged in many Chinese cities, caused by rapid industrialization and urbanization in the past four decades of economic boom. Originating from rural villages, their transformation hints an interesting discrepancy between top-down policy and its informal understanding and implementation by the individual actors or organizations in the village.

	    <br><br>
	    Chinese urban villages are different from typical slums, they might be facing similar issues, but they are fundamentally different. Buildings in Urban villages are of villagers’ own, inherited from their ancestors, they have absolute ownership of the land and their houses.

	    <br><br>
	    Urban villages exist as islands in the cities. They run counter to Chinese government's formal urban construction and planning rules, creating and fostering an urban typology that includes multiple spatial conditions, entrepreneurial behaviours, and multiple stakeholders.

            <h2>Conditions in Urban Villages</h2>
            Urban villages exist as islands in the cities. They run counter to Chinese government's formal urban construction and planning rules, creating and fostering an urban typology that includes multiple spatial conditions, entrepreneurial behaviours, and multiple stakeholders.

            <br><br>
	        Some common characteristics of urban villages are the over-crowded streets and alleyways and extreme building density, existing as the grey area under city’s building codes, resultant from the grace period during city expansion process.

            This thesis will use urban villages in Guangzhou as case studies to investigates the formation process of urban villages and explores potential interventions that could be implemented in the villages to improve their conditions.

            <br><br>
            Haizhu district is the central island of Guangzhou, enclosed by Pearl River, just opposite the Tianhe CBD. The island is greatly connected to other parts of Guangzhou with 12 bridges and 6 metro lines. Areas of urban villages on Haizhu island is 12km2, occupying 15% of the land.

            <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Site Context Analysis</h3>
            There are altogether 288 urban villages in Guangzhou city, due to the huge quantity and limited time, this research will focus on Longtan Village on Haizhu Island. It is situated at the Longtan Interchange between two major roads, accessible to 3 metro stations.

            <br><br>
            Building footprint of each blocks in urban villages are much smaller compared to  normal condiminium estates. As each land plots cannot be enlarged, villagers grow their buildings vertically to increase rental income. The highest in the village is 8 storeys.

            <br><br>
            Unlike usual residential estates, urban villages normally do not have fences to define the boundary. As city expands its development, urban villages are slowly surrounded by housing and commercial developments. Even though urban villages do not build fence or walls to define their boundary, there are some concrete walls build along their periphery to separate them from the neighbouring estates. Canals act as a natural barrier between urban villages and the outside world. Village is only accessible through the several entrances indicated in the diagram.

            General Circulation in the Village
            <br><br>
            Using agents to simulate movement on the site to understand circulation condition in the village. Using Path-following behaviour of agents, starting from the polygon centres, finding the nearest path and move along it. In urban village context, the agents could be representing people, the trails of their movements representing possible human movement in this region. The short-cut that cuts through some buildings may indicating the potential shortcuts of bypass of road that will appear in the process of human activity.

            <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Circulation Study in Zoom-in Area</h3>
            In order to understand the movement pattern inside the village, we simulate movement behaviour in a more zoom in area. This comparative test compares the movement behaviour of agents on ground level when starting at different locations. Every parameter is constant throughout all simulations except for their starting positions: agents spread out randomly, gathered at top, middle and bottom zones of the selected site respectively.

            <br><br>
            This comparison <i>(Fig.6)</i> helps to identify the condition of connectivity of paths on the site. When agents starting spread out randomly on the site, the site ‘light up’ quickly as all the paths are activated. When agents are gathered in one zone, it takes longer time to activate the site, they tend to remain in their own area.
            <br><br>
            Agents starting at top, middle and bottom zones of the site respectively help to observe the connectivity of different areas of the site. Results showed that agents starting at the top zone are able to travel to the bottom areas eventually, agents from middle zones are less likely to travel around the site, and agents from bottom zone seldom travel to the top area of the site.

            <br><br>
            The existence of divergent paths in the middle zone give agents more road options when travelling within this area, hence able to hold them moving within this zone for longer time. Agents from this zone travels to the bottom area via a lengthways path. Although agents travel to top areas as well but not as many as staying in bottom zone. This gives the credit to the developed road system in the bottom zone, which helps to guide circulations within this area. Agents starting at bottom zone have never visited the top zone, only a few have entered middle zone. Means the lengthways path is not successful in bringing agents to the middle zone, this is also because of the developed road system which is able to guide and hold agents within its area.

            <h2>Design Internvention</h2>
            <h3>Intervention Strategy</h3>
            From observations on previous simulations, we can find that there exist horizontal movement because most alleys are linear and parallel, in areas with more divergent paths, agents could develop more road options, hence these areas are visited more frequently by agents compared to others, as indicated by the lighter and thicker green lines (agent trail).

            <br><br>
            Movement breaks from top to bottom at middle area because of these divergent paths, they can attract agents to wander and stay in this area. The ground level is packed with buildings and alleys, hence it will be meaningful to introduce some longitudinal movement to the site on the roof level, to build a second ground that supplement ground functions.

            <br><br>
            The paper discusses two areas of interventions that have been identified:

            <br><br>
                1. locating the connecting bridges
            <br><br>
                2. Articulating new public spaces on the roofscape
            <br><br>
                3. Dispacing Mass

            Roof Conditions Analysis
            <br><br>
            Building a platform on the roof requires to connect some of the roofs, hence computation tool Grasshopper is used to find out the possible connection points on the roof level, satisfying several requirements such as shorter than 2m, between same height opposite roofs.

            <br><br>
            Building with existing roof access will be ideal choices. This diagram highlighted buildings on this site with existing roof access, in order to suggest availability of roofs on the site. Building roofs that are opposite and same height are connected using the shortest distance path in between on the above diagram. Different shades of grey indicate the roof level. This diagram helps to highlight building roofs that have the potential to create a connected roofscape.

            Finding Path for Roof Platform with Agent-Based Modelling
            <br><br>
            Path-following behavior of agents constrains the agents not to travel to black areas where the roofs are non-accessible by the public.
                        The simulation results <i>(Fig.9)</i> showed some jump by agents in order to move to nearby available roofs but not connected with given path. These “jumps” hint where additional connections could add in to help the overall connection. This result suggested a general location and direction of roof level path. Roofs that are not connected to the main corridor path, could be islands of public spaces that not connected to the main circulation.

            <h2>Design Intervention</h2>
            <h3>Form Exploration</h3>
            As the buildings in the village are privately and individually owned, directly requisite many privately-owned roofs for public use will face many difficulties. The buildings are designed and constructed by informal contractors; the architecture may not be able to support large public activities on top. Hence our strategy is to build a lightweight structure that float on top of the village, occupying minimum footprint on ground level.

            <br><br>
            With heavy weight on top of the structure <i>(Fig.10 Top Left)</i>, it is foreseeable to topple over. This simulation not only showed which direction the structure will fall but also the deformation that would happen to this steel structure.

            <br><br>
            With 3 similar structure leaning on each other, the combined structure became more stable <i>(Fig.10 Bottom Left)</i>, the resultant force by weight of each floor slab on the three are counter balanced, allowing them to stand even with such small footprint.

            <h3>Hex Canopy</h3>
            <br><br>
            From structure analysis, the most stable structure combination would be 3-hexagon towers with rectangles being the middle support structure frame. Hence this set of 3 towers design will be applied on the roof level, with the proposed connection path from agents-based simulation previously <i>(Fig. 11)</i>.

            <br><br>
            As buildings footprint varies largely across the urban village, hexagon shape covering each building will be in different size, sometimes distortion of hexagon shape is needed in order to achieve the optimal stability of the structure

            Agent-Based Modelling is used again to test the circulation on the site after introducing the vertical circulation to roof level and longitudinal corridor path above the roof <i>(Fig.11)</i>. The  addition of Hex Canopy over the site has introduced more longitudinal circulations on the site, meaning the Canopy not only provide more space for public activities but also able to help ease the heavy traffic on ground level.
