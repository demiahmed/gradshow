Fast Forward to 2020, dense urban centers have little greenfield land & typically consist of pockets of space which aspire efficient utilization. These erstwhile developments lag behind in advancements of urban codes & dynamic societal aspirations. Transportation infrastructure has progressed to more complicated typologies, far beyond what TODs have kept pace with."," As a graduate architecture student, I have been interested at the application of technology in the urban design discourse and devising interventions which serve the community. Cities and communities are banks of big data created due to human activities and are hence, ripe for disruption via data-driven decisions.     <br><br>I like to believe that technology has a colossal role to play in meeting our societal needs as we chart our journey towards a sustainable future.",ddd@gmail.com,0,ii,https://google.com,0
