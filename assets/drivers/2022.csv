However, the lack of awareness on proper recycling practices and lack of strict enforcement through legislation continues to hamper Singapore’s community efforts in recycling. Precedent studies of overseas waste management systems reveal that a mix of government legislation, infrastructure and societal engagement have been effective in cultivating recycling etiquettes. Given the importance of infrastructure and community action in achieving strong recycling rates, is it possible to redesign the waste management infrastructure in Singapore to achieve similar results among the community? Apart from high operation and maintenance costs of dedicated plastic recycling facilities, land constraints restrict the expansion of the plastic recycling industry in Singapore, especially in the neighbourhoods. However, the country could revive existing structures with new programme and innovative plastic construction assemblies to aid the transformation. Therefore, this thesis explores the potential of a community-focused recycling centre to address the nation’s low recycling rates. The project takes on a multi-pronged approach, tackling the lack of knowledge with education while creating recycled plastic building components to build a community identity. It aims to cultivate long-lasting recycling habits among the people by engaging them throughout the recycling process, from material preparation all the way to manufacturing. The intervention de-stigmatises the waste management processing by adding value to the surrounding neighbourhood, and it seeks to raise awareness of sustainable resource consumption by increasing the interaction with recycling processes and the daily activities of the community. The thesis uses the Singapore Science Centre (SSC), a significant community node in the Jurong Lake District (JLD), as a platform to test the Re:CC intervention. The transformation will enable the SSC to serve as a recycling node for the entire JLD. Spatial values of Community Centres (CCs) are combined with technical requirements of a plastic processing facility to develop a design that promotes education, collaboration, and local manufacturing.",,,,,,

This concept would also strive in polycentric cities where the cumulative efforts of each neighbourhood can come together and allow the city to progress towards a circular economy in a country. To create a net-zero circular city, it is important for the cities to work on their resource flow and create a self-driving system. Community energy can be used in future cities as a catalyst for energy behaviour change. This can be achieved through creating locally owned and locally sited renewable energy. With resources now consumed and produced within their own city, it allows a net-zero circular economy to strive. As the residents are now actively involved in their living space while they participate in locally owned and locally sited renewable energy, this newly optimised city would allow for environmental and social goals to converge.",,,,,,

By removing selected portions of the existing concrete structure and overlaying lighter Mass Engineered Timber modules, the existing HDB flats are able to grow in volume and intensity within the same footprint. My proposed design intervention exploits the opportunity to build on top of the heavier remaining concrete with lighter and more sustainable timber, reforming public housing developments and the associated public spaces.",,,,,,

Traditional modes of construction are unable to cope with these en masse shifts. Amongst them, the forcibly displaced are housed in temporary structures that meet their most basic needs. While being wholly dependent on humanitarian aid, they lose their agency. This thesis aims to break the notion that infrastructure reinforces territorialisation by consolidating power, but instead provides opportunities for the displaced to achieve economic stability and eventually regain agency.  	This thesis studies the application of a quick-build, designed for disassembly system to be employed as temporary infrastructure. Such infrastructure aims to be used as socio-economic leverage in less stable communities through creating large scale, yet temporal workplaces such as marketplaces, offices, vocational training and educational facilities.  A kit of parts is developed with the underlying principles of circular economy and material sustainability.",,,,,,

The productive ecosystems will be largely dependant on salt in seawater as a resource and through a time-based approach see through the incorporation of brackish - saline based systems.   It acknowledges that existing delta deterioration (sinkage and shrinkage) is  largely influenced by a multitude of factors, both climatic and anthropogenic. Hence, the thesis will pivot from a trigger point when upstream communities decide to cut damming and remove existing dams from the delta system. Next, it proceeds to develop the scenario of when the river and sediment flows are replenished to pre dam levels through sediment-enhancing river diversions and begin the testing of using saline in the fully saline city through a naturalized desalination process. In the near future, there will come a time when the two process are incorporated and this leads to the formation of the  City of Salinity - SALINICITY  The study is situated upon the Mekong Delta (MKD), with interventions conducted in the district of Ba Tri, Ben Tre, South MKD.

Amongst the various building typologies such as floating villages and European colonial buildings, the most iconic is the shophouse typology. An entire town of shophouses provides an historical window to the previous centuries and allows for appreciation of culture. This has drawn many tourists as well as pensioners who seek a comfortable retirement place. However, pockets of ruins and dilapidation plague the town. This thesis project wishes to study the abandonment of an entire street of shophouses fronting a restored canal, that possesses great historical and cultural values, and adapt the existing architecture to contribute to the local residents and tourists.",,,,,,
