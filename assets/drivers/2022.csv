The general sentiment is that high density compromises the liveability of a city. Growing numbers of urbanists have argued that density is not to be blamed, but the equitable access to green is. However with global economic development and rapid urban expansion, the resultant dense cityscapes are at risk of further marginalising the innate relationship between Man and Nature. There is a growing need to create a new model of development for resilient and sustainable cities to mitigate the negative impacts of high-density living for present and future generations. To ensure future cities will continue to thrive, architectural designs should not compromise the health and wellbeing of its people. Stigmatised as cold and sterile, there is a growing need to mitigate the disparity between the aspirations and impacts of healthcare facilities as a place of respite for people. Based on the premise that reciprocal benefits exist between nature and human’s health and wellbeing since ancient times, there is an imperative need for biophilic design to be integrated into today’s healthcare facilities.

However, the lack of awareness on proper recycling practices and lack of strict enforcement through legislation continues to hamper Singapore’s community efforts in recycling. Precedent studies of overseas waste management systems reveal that a mix of government legislation, infrastructure and societal engagement have been effective in cultivating recycling etiquettes. Given the importance of infrastructure and community action in achieving strong recycling rates, is it possible to redesign the waste management infrastructure in Singapore to achieve similar results among the community? Apart from high operation and maintenance costs of dedicated plastic recycling facilities, land constraints restrict the expansion of the plastic recycling industry in Singapore, especially in the neighbourhoods. However, the country could revive existing structures with new programme and innovative plastic construction assemblies to aid the transformation. Therefore, this thesis explores the potential of a community-focused recycling centre to address the nation’s low recycling rates. The project takes on a multi-pronged approach, tackling the lack of knowledge with education while creating recycled plastic building components to build a community identity. It aims to cultivate long-lasting recycling habits among the people by engaging them throughout the recycling process, from material preparation all the way to manufacturing. The intervention de-stigmatises the waste management processing by adding value to the surrounding neighbourhood, and it seeks to raise awareness of sustainable resource consumption by increasing the interaction with recycling processes and the daily activities of the community. The thesis uses the Singapore Science Centre (SSC), a significant community node in the Jurong Lake District (JLD), as a platform to test the Re:CC intervention. The transformation will enable the SSC to serve as a recycling node for the entire JLD. Spatial values of Community Centres (CCs) are combined with technical requirements of a plastic processing facility to develop a design that promotes education, collaboration, and local manufacturing.",Natalie is an architectural designer who enjoys creating spaces that encourage human interaction.
