                <p>

                Welcome to the 7th SUTD Master of Architecture public review. This event gives us the pleasure to present our thesis projects: the culmination of the two terms of research and design exploration framed by SUTD's vision of technologically driven innovation. This year the projects for the first time have been developed within our MArch LABS, groups of faculty and students working in collaboration on urgent challenges faced by our profession, cities and world. Please read more about the MArch LABs<a href="../index.html"> here </a>.  

                </p>

                <h2>Design Beyond Zero</h2>

                <p>
                    This year's exhibition theme, Design Beyond Zero, focuses our attention on the urgent challenges of zero carbon and zero waste architecture. To ground our students work in this thematic area, we hosted a series of lectures in over the past 8 months which included the speakers: 
      
                    <br><br>
                    Arthur Huang, Founder and CEO of Miniwiz, 
                    Naree Phinyawatana, Director at Atelier Ten, 
                    Liu Thai Ker, Chairman of MORROW Architects + Planners, 
                    Melvin Tan, President of SIA and Deputy Managing Director at LAUD Architects. 
                       

                    <br><br>
                    Ken Yeang, Executive Director, Hamzah & Yeang, led a masterclass with our students, reviewing their early thesis proposals, and gave a public lecture on his renowned bioclimatic architecture, with reflections on the next generation of sustainable environments. 

                    <br><br>
                    Envisioning Design Beyond Zero is a task our SUTD MArch students are prepared for as designers, critical thinkers and as citizens. Our students are empowered by a self-motivated and research-intensive approach to the MArch. Their research topics germinate over a structured internship, develop into problem statements during a thesis preparation term spearheaded by the MArch LABS, and are articulated as designs in the thesis term. As you will see in these pages, our students combine expansive architectural design capabilities with the critical mindset and ability to test their claims by gathering, generating, understanding, and communicating data. 

                    <br><br>
                    Please visit our <a href="https://asd.sutd.edu.sg/programme/master-of-architecture/"> SUTD MArch Overview </a> to learn more about our programme.


                    <br><br>
                    We hope that you will enjoy the projects and that we can recruit your support for our next generation of architects as they make their own pathways to creating a better and more sustainable world by design.

                <p>
                    I want to warmly welcome you to the 7th SUTD Master of Architecture public review. I am happy to witness the conclusion of the inaugural M.Arch Labs. The birth of M.Arch labs presented the opportunity for Architecture & Sustainable Design to build bodies of knowledge on strategic architectural challenges. The labs were complimented by a number of smaller independent studios that continue to offer opportunities for more diverse and independent exploration of lesser-tackled architectural issues. 
      
                    <br><br>
                    The new M.Arch labs also witnesses the first implementation of a thesis preparation phase in term 9 followed by a thesis term in term 10. This revision allows students to devote longer time for thorough research before launching into design. Both the incorporation of labs and longer timeframe also mean that industry players could impart more in-depth knowledge and quality teaching time with the students.

                    <br><br>
                    Common to all labs is the theme of “Design beyond Zero”. The challenges to achieve carbon neutrality in the next few decades loom large. There is a need for all thesis projects to aspire towards Net Zero targets and beyond. ASD must continue to research and develop new solutions to support the design for a Net Zero world.

                    <br><br>
                    On this note, I would like to express my appreciation to all our faculty and staff members, external reviewers and helpers for your tireless efforts to support our next generation of architects. I would also like to take this chance to congratulate our M.Arch class a successful completion of your project and time in ASD. I am quite certain that some of you may go on to win international recognition for your thesis project. However, the most important next step is for you to take what you have learnt and contribute to society in a sustainable way.
