                    Welcome to the 8th SUTD Master of Architecture public review. This event gives us the pleasure to present our thesis projects: the culmination of the two terms of research and design exploration framed by SUTD's vision of technologically driven innovation. This year's projects have been developed within our MArch LABS, groups of faculty and students working in collaboration on urgent challenges faced by our profession, cities and world.  Please read more about the MArch LABs<a href="#dbz"> here </a>.

                <h2>Research / Praxis</h2>

                <p>
                    This year's exhibition theme, Research/ Praxis, highlights the continual renewal of the architecture profession by innovative young practicioners, emphasizing the role of research in their innovations. The poster sessions and exhibition juries advance discourse on the transformative capacity of research to produce new means of understanding, generating and valorising architecture. To ground our discourse on the theme of Research / Praxis, we have hosted a series of lectures in over the past two terms which included the speakers: 
      
                    <br><br>
                    Usman Haque (Umbrellium) <br>
                    Calvin Chua (Spatial Anatomy) <br>
                    Chan Soo Khian (SCDA) <br>
                    Cat Huang & Brian Yang (BIG) <br>
                    Chie Konno (teco, KIT) <br>
                    
                       

                    <br><br>
                    In coordination with these exhibition year's theme the Praxis Innovation prize will be awarded for the first time in 2023. This prize recognizes the MArch thesis that most compellingly articulates the value proposition of architecture while responding creatively to the parameters of architectural practice.
                </p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Our Programme</h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating research and praxis is a task our SUTD MArch students are prepared for as designers, critical thinkers and as citizens. Our students are empowered by a self-motivated and research-intensive approach to the MArch. Their research topics germinate over a structured internship, develop into problem statements during a thesis preparation term spearheaded by the MArch LABS, and are articulated as designs in the thesis term. As you will see in these pages, our students combine expansive architectural design capabilities with the critical mindset and ability to test their claims by gathering, generating, understanding, and communicating data. 
                
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    We hope that you will enjoy the projects and that we can recruit your support for our next generation of architects as they make their own pathways to creating a better and more sustainable world by design.

                <p>
                    Against the backdrop of recovery from a pandemic world, the architectural profession continues to battle challenging conditions of practice. ASD carries the heavy responsibility of producing more fresh graduates of the profession and to appropriately advise them on their future directions. The best way of enhancing the prospects of the architectural profession is to embrace the value created by research and design. ASD firmly believes in the novelty of research and design and will continue to put the highest emphasis on this important differentiation. 
      
                    <br><br>
                    Aptly titled Research / Praxis, this year's exhibition theme highlights the ongoing research work carried out by our most senior students from the M.Arch class. Our students spend a full term on group research effort addressing various thematic areas affecting the current world. These topics include the most urgent issues such as Net Zero, Future Health, Future Building, and Climate Change. There are also new emerging areas of research such as the integration of physical and virtual world through the ethical use of AI and Machine learning. This research phase is followed closely by the individual thesis exploration in the final term. 

                    <br><br>
                    Such a co-ordinated approach enables ASD to build up a body of research knowledge as well as responses of solutions. In the next few years, it will allow ASD to present a collection of viable solutions that could prove to be valuable antidote for some of the most wicked problems that our world faces. In this way, our alumni will also have the opportunity to join existing students of ASD for continual research, collaboration, and mentorship. 

                    <br><br>
                    On this note, I would like to express my appreciation to all our faculty and staff members, external reviewers, and helpers for your tireless efforts to support our next generation of architects. I would also like to take this chance to congratulate our M.Arch class on a successful completion of your project and time in ASD. I am quite certain that some of you will go on to successful careers soon. However, the most important next step is for you to take what you have learnt and contribute to society in a sustainable way.

        <br>
        <p class="bottom solo left">advisors: Jason Lim, Christine Yogiaman, Zheng Kai  and Bige Tuncer</p>
        <p class="bottom solo left">Future Health formulates a new system of architecture for healing that responds to the fluctuating uncertainty in healthcare needs. This MArch lab propels the spatial understanding of thermodynamic exchange, environmental systems and material effects towards the architecture of embodied sensorial experience.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="bottom solo left medium white">Inhabiting New Futures: Oceanic Environments and New Habitats</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bottom solo left">advisor: Eva Castro, Form Axioms</p>
        <p class="bottom solo left">Inhabiting New Futures focuses on modes of adaptation to extreme climatic changes, specifically that of the sea levels rise. The work devises strategies of co-operation and co-inhabitation in the oceans, with a shift from âdesignâ taken as a process to deploy âobjectsâ, to âdesignâ as a process to fabricate processes âstrategic/tactical, resilient in the in the long run.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="bottom solo left medium white">Circular Cities Lab</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bottom solo left">advisor: F Peter Ortner</p>
        <p class="bottom solo left">Circular Cities Lab envisions architecture as the enabler of a circular urban metabolism, supported by parallel investigations at the scale of the city and of fabrication. Industrial ecology techniques, like material flow analysis, are appropriated for use in design scenario exploration. Computational form generation and performance assessment drives a design process that imaginatively pushes toward a zero waste, positive energy city.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="bottom solo left medium white">Artificial-Architecture</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bottom solo left">advisor: Immanuel Koh</p>
        <p class="bottom solo left">Artificial-Architecture is led by Immanuel Koh using the independent March thesis as a vehicle for design research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in architecture, and exploration of architectural design with Neurotechnology and Metaverse.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p class="bottom solo left medium white">Future Construction</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bottom solo left">advisor: Daniel Whittaker</p>
        <p class="bottom solo left">Future construction investigates the architectural potential of advances in automation and materials, with emphasis on light-weight and sustainable construction. With his advisees Daniel develops theses related to adaptive reuse, tectonics and heritage. Daniel is also leader of the Combined Thesis Studio, which brings together students with independent advisors in a customized design studio that builds shared methods and dialogue.</p>
